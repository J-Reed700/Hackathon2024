By signing up for BigTime, you can jump start your ability to run a smarter, more productive, and more profitable business. BigTime offers a range of features that can help you manage your projects, track your time, and streamline your workflow. With BigTime, you can improve your team's collaboration and communication, and gain valuable insights into your business performance. By using BigTime, you can take your business to the next level and achieve greater success.",127
2,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: BigTime System Guide

Solution: The BigTime System Guide provides users with a comprehensive overview of the system's functionality and how to use it effectively. The guide covers topics such as organizing customer data into projects, adding staff members to the BigTime Staff List, and updating metrics and reports in real-time. Users are encouraged to link their QuickBooks account to import basic information and avoid manual data entry. 

To get started with BigTime, users should sign up using the link in their email invitation and set up their profile and password. If users have trouble finding a specific feature, they should talk to their admin about changing their user rights. 

Users should also add values to the four Field Value categories to provide more information about their staffers and projects. These values will populate in picklists throughout BigTime and can be edited over time as business needs change. Users can also customize the Project Dashboard by adding details such as project type and company credit cards for expense entries. 

In addition, users should create and edit values for each category under Basic Codes to properly use BigTime's workflow. These values can be linked with QuickBooks and customized to fit the needs of the business. 

Users can also add cost center values to designate the department responsible for a cost and apply them to the Project Dashboard for each project. This allows users to run reports and see which staffer types cost the most money. 

Finally, users should utilize their BigTime Inbox as a personal management system to add to-dos and customize their view by created date or type. Activities can be marked as complete and moved to the archived list.",323
3,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: BigTime Management System Features
Solution: The BigTime Management System offers various features to help users manage their tasks and delegate work effectively. 

The BigTime Inbox serves as a personal management system where users can add to-do lists for themselves or their staff. Users can customize their inbox view by created date or type, and completed items disappear once marked as complete. Staffers can subscribe or unsubscribe from system notices, delete assigned activity messages, and control whether their BigTime inbox is linked to their email. System admins can monitor individual user settings.

The mobile app is organized around key areas of work, including Timesheets, Expenses, Project List, and Staff List. Users can access timers from the home page to make it easier to track time. The project and staff lists are automatically connected to maps, phone, and email functions, allowing users to tap on a client's address to open the maps app, dial a phone number, or send a quick note via email. Data is synced with the BigTime website behind the scenes, and users can log their time or expenses offline, which will sync with the website when a connection is available. Most screens in the system support drag-refresh, allowing users to update their local data cache easily.

Users can invite new users to BigTime from the Staff List by clicking the Invite hyperlink on the Staff Dashboard. Staffers who receive an email invite can set up their BigTime password and start using the system. Users can resend an invite if the user doesn't receive it.

Users can delegate work using project, tasks, and activities. Projects are the broad initiatives that need to be completed, tasks are the action items to execute to complete the project, and activities are small to-dos and reminders. Users can assign work to staffers if they are a system admin or staffer with specific user rights. Resource allocation can be used to manage projects and staffers effectively, plan for future work, allocate staff time, and make informed business decisions based on the vast amount of data available.",402
4,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: How to effectively manage projects and staff using BigTime software
Solution: 

BigTime software offers a range of features to help businesses manage their projects and staff effectively. Here are some tips on how to use BigTime to its fullest potential:

1. Use the hierarchy of projects, tasks, and activities to organize your work. Assign work to staffers with specific user rights and use resource allocation to manage your projects and staffers effectively.

2. Customize security access by assigning each staffer a security group or creating your own group. Use the on and off switches within a security group to eliminate or add rights within a specific group.

3. Create staff departments values that are relevant to your firm and add staffers to a department. Give certain staffers in your company managerial rights to oversee specific departments.

4. Most of the information you enter into BigTime rolls up into a project. When you log time, expenses, or tasks, you must assign them to a project. Firms that don't use projects can still use BigTime.

5. Assign a team lead to a project team to access and approve timesheets, expenses, and budgets for staffers assigned to a particular project. Restrict staffer ability to log time and expenses to specific projects.

6. Create contacts when you start a new project so you have someone to reach out to when you've got project questions or concerns. Add contacts to each project manually or let BigTime copy contacts for you. Incorporate as many contacts as you'd like, but you can only have one billing and one primary contact. Add as much contact information as possible, including contact type and role, to keep you organized.

By following these tips, you can effectively manage your projects and staff using BigTime software.",348
5,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: Adding and managing contacts in BigTime

Solution: When starting a new project in BigTime, it is important to create contacts to reach out to for any project-related questions or concerns. Contacts can be added manually or copied from existing contacts. It is recommended to add as much contact information as possible, including contact type and role, to keep contacts organized. BigTime allows for the addition of custom fields to personalize projects and provide additional information. It is also important to add client information to utilize other BigTime functions.",105
6,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: Task Management in BigTime

Solution: BigTime offers a comprehensive task management system that allows firms to efficiently manage their projects. Tasks are at the center of workflow in BigTime and are the key to setting project budgets, schedules, and assignments. Tasks can be grouped into subtasks, established as one-time events, or a recurring series. They can also be included on invoices and featured in reports to get better estimates and track budgets. 

Firms can refer to tasks as something other than tasks and update the verbiage in BigTime. The Task Dashboard and the Task Editor in the Project Dashboard are two features where tasks can be entered and assigned. Tasks can be added one at a time or in bulk. 

To save time, firms can create recurring tasks that will automatically populate on the time interval of their choosing. Recurring tasks consist of a series master and occurrences, which contain information on every task occurrence: assignments, due dates, and budget information. 

BigTime's Gantt chart feature offers a fast load time, even with thousands of tasks. Projects that have more than 1000 tasks on screen have a sub-one second load time. The Auto-Schedule feature allows firms to shift a task and all of its dependencies automatically. The Critical Path feature allows firms to see the critical tasks that need to be done to complete a project. 

To ensure efficient workflow, all time entered into the system must be submitted before it can proceed to any other workflow. Firms can choose the workflows that work best for them, including Review/Approval, Invoicing, and Posting to their accounting system.",325
7,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: BigTime - Managing Time, Expenses, and Reports

Solution: BigTime is a comprehensive system that allows firms to manage their time, expenses, and reports efficiently. Here are some takeaways to help you get started:

1. Time Management: All time entered into the system must be submitted before it can proceed to any other workflow. Choose the workflows that work best for your firm. There are three primary optional workflows within the system: Review/Approval, Invoicing, and Posting to your accounting system. Ensure all time is reviewed and approved before it's billed or reimbursed. Choose from several review and approval workflows. You decide who'll review and approve timesheets. Examples include managers, financial admins, team roles, and departments. Set up billable/non-billable approvals to streamline the approval process. Managers and team leads can approve submitted time for the same individual.

2. Timer: Think of timers like a stopwatch tracking your time minute-by-minute, second-by-second. Keep track of total work time. You can start and pause a timer as often as you need, and your timer will show the total amount of time clocked. Track work-in-progress easily with a timer. This is helpful when an unexpected meeting or phone call comes up. Start a timer, then fill in the details later. Switch between timers easily. Set up several timers and switch among them during your day.

3. Expense Management: Expenses in BigTime are either reimbursable or non-reimbursable, which determines whether or not the staffer will get refunded for an expense. Staffers must include an expense type for each entered expense. Expense types, which are often referred to as expense codes, categorize the expense. Examples may include R&D, office expenses, and travel. These values are found in a picklist when staffers enter a new expense. Most firms have employees submit expenses on a schedule that mirrors their payroll periods. An Expense that has been entered but not yet submitted is considered unsubmitted. The unsubmitted expense may be viewed by a Manager, but the Manager cannot do anything with the expense until it has been submitted. The Expense Review feature is optional. After an expense has been submitted, it is entirely up to the firm what to do with it. Just keep in mind that the expense review/approval process can prevent the invoicing of expenses that should not be charged to the client, or can confirm that an employee expense qualifies for reimbursement. Managers can make corrections to submitted expenses.

4. Reports: Use pre-built reports from four categories: time tracking reports, invoice reports, payroll invoice reports, and task list reports. Create custom reports. Generate a report that only shows the data you want to see. Restrict report access. Use report permission settings, security groups, and customized user access rights to determine who can access your firm's reports. Share reports among your firm's BigTime users. For example, share billing reports with your accountants; share project and task reports with project managers. Restrict content access, so staffers only see the information you want them to see. Make reports public so staffers can get a grasp on project progress and their performance.",639
8,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: Tips for using BigTime for project management and invoicing

Solution: 

1) Use cost rate to determine how much a staffer costs your company and run a report to find out if they are hurting your company from a cost perspective. Use a pre-built report to see the billable utilization rate for your employees. Use realization as a metric to compare the number of billable hours an employee logged in BigTime to the amount that's invoiced. 

2) Create an invoice for any project in the system, at any time. Each invoice that you create utilizes an invoicing style. BigTime supports manual, time & materials, fixed fee, retainer, and other invoicing styles. When you create a new invoice, it's considered a draft until you send it. Once an invoice is sent to your customer, it becomes a final invoice (and is part of your firm's payables). 

3) Consolidate invoices to send your client one invoice with all the necessary information. View and edit a consolidated invoice, much like you would view and edit any invoice you create. Any invoices that are created on the same day for this client will be consolidated automatically when they're created. 

4) Use invoice review and approvals as a safeguard against errors, from inaccurate expenses to typos. This feature allows multiple people across your firm to review and approve an invoice. You can choose from various combinations of staffers, departments, and roles. 

5) Gain control over your invoices by adding detailed descriptions, formulas that automatically calculate, as well as conditions to execute line items only if the condition is met. Use custom invoices for any number of your invoicing needs, such as retainer-based billing, deposits and credits, discounted rates, and administrative markups.",355
9,QuickBooks,Takeaways,"Topic: Integrating BigTime with Other Applications

Solution: BigTime offers integration with various applications to streamline workflow processes. Here are some key takeaways for integrating BigTime with other applications:

1. Linking BigTime with Google: Your BigTime and Google email addresses should match. If they don't, BigTime will send a confirmation to your Google email. You'll need to click the link in that email message to complete the Open ID connection. If you are already a BigTime user, you can link your BigTime account to your Google Apps login. Once the accounts are linked, you are automatically logged into BigTime whenever you are logged into Google.

2. Using Zapier: You don't need a programmer to use Zapier because there is no coding involved. Available to IQ Pro users, the workflow setup process is easy and intuitive. Zapier's setup process allows a BigTime administrator user to choose one application to be a trigger app. The secondary app is the action app. The following features within BigTime are enabled for zaps: Invoices, Tasks, Projects, Creating Time/Expense Entries. In addition to Zapier and QuickBooks, BigTime connects with even more applications. To see the list, go to MY COMPANY … INTEGRATIONS.

3. Syncing with Lacerte: TaxLink is the synchronization tool between BigTime and Lacerte. TaxLink serves as the syncing tool between BigTime and Lacerte. Your firm should download the application on the machine that you would like to designate as the liaison between the two systems. Syncing is a one-way process from Lacerte to BigTime. Do your work in Lacerte, and TaxLink will keep an eye on changes made there and sync that data in BigTime. Easily manage and track your returns on the Engagement Dashboard.

4. Integrating with Salesforce: Create a new opportunity in Salesforce and have it populate as a new project in BigTime, once the opportunity reaches a specific stage in your sales pipeline. Add details to a project in BigTime, and sync them to your opportunity in Salesforce. Sync your BigTime data automatically or manually. Have your BigTime data sync automatically with Salesforce. Or manually sync it and have your BigTime data appear instantly in Salesforce. View BigTime project data in Salesforce. See details, like tracked time and submitted expenses, that you added in BigTime inside Salesforce. Now your project and sales teams are connected and informed throughout the life of a project.

5. Integrating with QuickBooks: Communication between BigTime and QuickBooks happens in the cloud. Put another way, you tell BigTime and QuickBooks what to do, and the work is completed behind the scenes. Integration with QuickBooks Desktop or Online is easy to setup. Integrate your BigTime account with either version of QuickBooks within minutes. QuickBooks Desktop users need to download BigTime's Sync Agent, which syncs information from QuickBooks Desktop to BigTime. However, QuickBooks Online users don't need to download additional software. Synchronization of data between BigTime and QuickBooks is controlled by you. You can turn BigTime's automatic sync feature on or off. That means, transactional data, such as timesheets, expenses, or invoices, aren't shared from QuickBooks to BigTime without your permission.

6. Syncing with QuickBooks Online: Use the Integrations window in BigTime to link your QuickBooks Online account with BigTime. Sync data, like active Customer/Jobs, Employees, Vendors, Service items, automatically. Get on-demand information. Now it's easier than ever to stay informed and make sound business decisions, since you've got important details at your fingertips.",743

Solution: To effectively use BigTime to organize projects and clients, it is important to understand the difference between the flat view and the hierarchy view.

31,Lacerte,Troubleshooting,"Topic: Troubleshooting common issues in BigTime

Solution: 

1) Web browser compatibility: BigTime works with any modern browser, but Chrome has been optimized for lightning fast response times. If Safari or Internet Explorer are a little sluggish on your system, give Chrome a try.

2) Password recovery and change: If you forget your password, use the ""forgot my password"" link to recover it. If you're already logged in, follow the instructions in ""How to Change Your Password"" to update your existing password.

3) Login issues: To login to BigTime, you must be invited by the administrator for your firm's BigTime account. If you're not sure what email they have on file for you, talk to your admin. If you're the BigTime admin and you've forgotten which email you used to subscribe, contact support for assistance.

4) Project and department management: If you have time/expense review and approval access but can't see a certain project or users you manage, make sure you're added to the project team as a team lead and have access to the right security group. You also need permission to manage those staffers, which is achieved by ensuring that staffers you manage are added to the right department and that you are given management authority to that department from within your staffer profile.

5) Moving projects: You can move your project to another one by clicking on the gray ""MOVE"" button next to the client name field. BigTime will generate a window allowing you to move this project. Click on the gray arrow and select where you want to move your project from the picklist of your clients. Save your selection by clicking the blue ""MOVE"" button. When you return to your list of projects, you'll see the completed move.",357
32,Lacerte,Troubleshooting,"1) Topic: Troubleshooting common issues in BigTime project management software 
2) Solution: 
- To reassign tasks to another project, copy tasks from the old project to the new project and delete them from the old project. 
- To merge duplicate task records, merge one into the other. 
- To expand the view of the task dashboard, click on the icon pictured below to expand it to a full-screen view. 
- Only system administrators can add, remove, and arrange fields on the task dashboard. 
- If a staffer is not an admin user, they will not see the staffer picklist on the time entry screen. They will need the additional security right titled ENTER+SUBMIT TIMESHEETS FOR YOUR USERS and be added to a security group that has that right enabled. 
- To grant a user rights to enter time for another user, give the entry user management authority over the target user using BigTime's staff departments feature. 
- Admin users have the right to submit time for any user by default via the security right titled VIEW/MANAGE ANY STAFF MEMBER. To enable non-admin users to log time for any user, add them to a security group that has that permission enabled. 
- To set up a data-entry user with the right to log time for any user, create a new security group called Time Loggers and grant that group ONLY the VIEW/MANAGE ANY STAFF MEMBER and ENTER+SUBMIT TIMESHEET FOR YOUR USERS rights. 
- If you have been granted the rights required to enter time for another user, then you are able to submit time for that user. 
- The submission period can be changed in your BigTime settings.",343
33,Lacerte,Troubleshooting,"Topic: Timesheet Submission and Management
Solution: 

BigTime offers various submission periods, including weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, and monthly. Users can change the start date of their timesheet weeks, which is reflected on the submission page. Users can submit a partial week/period, but any time entered in the first part of the week will be locked and cannot be edited. If the administrator hasn't locked the period, users can add new entries to their timesheet, but cannot edit existing entries. Only admins or users with certain permissions can edit submitted entries, including deleting them or rejecting them and routing them back to users for editing and re-submission. Admin users can see who has submitted time and who hasn't, and can use the staff timesheet summary report to view total hours entered and total hours submitted by staff members. If the timesheets to submit footer disappears, users can log out and log back in to make it reappear. 

For troubleshooting, users who can't see a certain project for which they're responsible need to make sure they're added to the project team as a team lead. Department managers who can't see time or expenses for users they manage need access to the right security group and permission to manage those staffers. Users can copy expenses for speedier entry and can enter expenses even when they have a limited connection or are offline. A light gray cloud next to expenses indicates a pending data sync when the user is back online.",296
34,Lacerte,Troubleshooting,"Topic: Troubleshooting common issues with BigTime expense reports
Solution: 

If you are experiencing issues with syncing expenses with the web application, try establishing an internet connection and clicking on the expense with a gray or red cloud next to it to request a sync. If this does not resolve the issue, contact support@bigtime.net with detailed information on the problem.

Solution: The preparer mapping process can be skipped if necessary.

When it comes to tax preparation, the preparer mapping process can be a time-consuming task. However, it is an important step in ensuring that all necessary information is accurately recorded and reported. That being said, there may be situations where it is necessary to skip this process.

39,Managing Your Account,How To Create a Holiday Calendar,"Topic: How to create a holiday calendar in BigTime

Solution: Firms that use BigTime can create a holiday calendar to keep track of the holidays their staffers observe. When you add a holiday, BigTime will assume your staffers won't work that day and automatically removes it from their capacity. For instance, if a staffer's normal monthly capacity is 21 days, but they celebrate two holidays that month, their capacity for the month will be reduced to 19 days. Your staffers can still log time on that day if they need to, but their reduced capacity will be reflected in the Utilization Board, the Planning Board, and in any reports you create.

To create a holiday calendar in BigTime, follow these steps:

1. Click on ""MY COMPANY…MY COMPANY"" from the main navigation toolbar.
2. In your company settings window, click on the tab labeled ""HOLIDAYS"". If you haven't yet added any holidays, your window will look like this.
3. On the top left side of this window is a button labeled ""ADD HOLIDAY"", which you'll click to add any holiday to your calendar.
4. On the right side is a box with the calendar year. If you want to create a calendar for a future year, you can toggle between years by clicking on the ""GRAY ARROWS"" to the left and right of this field, or click directly on the field and select a year from the dropdown calendar that appears.
5. You'll also see a sidebar on the left where you can select ""COST CENTERS"" for your holidays. The value you select in this field will determine which of your staffers the holiday will apply to.
6. You have two options here: you can create a holiday that applies to your whole firm, or create a holiday that applies to only a specific cost center.

44,Managing Your Account,Getting Started Questions,"Topic: Common Questions and Answers for New Users of BigTime

Solution:
- New users do not have to connect with QuickBooks right away, but it can pre-populate project and staff lists.
- If a user decides to convert from a trial to a paid subscription, nothing will change. If they decide not to continue after the trial ends, all test data in their account will be removed after a month or so. If they need to create a new empty firm once their subscription starts, they can contact the support team to set up a second empty firm for their team to use going forward.
- When a user is ready to subscribe, their BigTime account manager will send an estimate for approval. Once approved, they will receive an invoice for the same amount as the estimate. Upon receipt of payment, their BigTime account (and all of the information in the system) will continue without interruption. If they have subscribed to BigTime IQ Pro, they will receive a link from their account manager to schedule a training call.
- During the 14-day free trial, users can add as many users as they'd like. After that, their IQ Pro subscription will be based on the number of users in their account.
- A user is any active staff record in a user's account, not just the people who log in to the system. For example, if a user enters time or runs reports on behalf of other people in their firm, each of those individuals must have an active staff record. This is what makes it possible for BigTime to track time, bill, run reports, etc. tied to an individual's activity.
- There are three ways to reach customer support: live chat, email, and phone. Live chat is recommended for quick one-off questions during business hours. Email (support@bigtime.net) should be used for issues that require details, like a screenshot, etc. If needed, follow up with a phone call (312.346.4646).

- Check the box next to ""this item is taxable"" if the value is associated with a taxable expense.
- Check the box next to ""this category is inactive (no longer used)"" if you want BigTime to archive a value and the data associated with it. This action will remove the code from the Expense Type picklist, and staffers will no longer be able to select it. However, BigTime saves the data associated with the value, which can be reactivated at any time by unchecking the box.
- Check the box next to ""this code is a service fee"" if the value is a non-reimbursable expense, such as equipment rental or a hosting fee.

209,"""Infrastructure, Security & Privacy""",Security in Bigtime,"Topic: BigTime's Security Protocols

Solution: BigTime takes security seriously and has implemented various measures to ensure the safety of client data. Here are some of the security protocols in place:

- Encryption: All traffic to BigTime is served over HTTPS and all datastores are encrypted. Snapshots, image-based backups, and sensitive data within the BigTime database are also encrypted.
- TLS 1.2: The BigTime application supports TLS 1.2 encryption protocol.
- Publicly Accessible Systems: BigTime resides in a Virtual Private Cloud on Amazon Web Services (AWS). Only HTTPS traffic is permitted to web servers through load balancers. Databases and support systems that do not require web access are not public-facing. AWS Shield, WAF, GuardDuty, and Cloudflare are also used to block suspicious traffic and denial-of-service attacks.
- Administrative Access: Administrative access to BigTime systems is tightly controlled and monitored. Selected essential members of the BigTime team have secure remote access capabilities, which rely on multiple layers of authentication.

210,"""Infrastructure, Security & Privacy""",Data Retention and Bigtime,"Topic: BigTime Data Backup and Storage

Solution: BigTime takes data protection seriously and utilizes Microsoft SQL's built-in backup engine to run full backups nightly, differentials throughout the day, and SQL logs every 5 minutes. Backup jobs run to an EBS volume on AWS, which is rated at 99.999% availability. Once the backup to EBS is complete, a snapshot of the volume is taken and stored on Amazon's S3 system, which is rated at 99.999999999% durability. All backup images are encrypted and replicated to a different AWS region. SQL Backup Logs are also copied and restored to a secondary server in a secondary availability zone. Backups are initially taken and stored on the US-EAST region of AWS, and as the jobs complete, the EBS volumes are snapshotted to S3 and replicated to the US-WEST region. BigTime maintains a 30-day archive of backups and tests backups by restoring the full production backup nightly to a test system to confirm backup integrity. Periodic restores of differentials are also performed to ensure functionality. Approved members of the leadership team can access production data and backups, and upon termination of a contract, client data can be wiped from the system upon request. However, at this time, the design of the multi-tenant database used by BigTime doesn't allow for the export of a single set of firm data from the system.",287

Solution: Custom cost rates allow for more accurate billing by accounting for the varying cost rates of different tasks. This article explains how to navigate to the custom cost rates feature and create custom rates for staffers in BigTime.

In BigTime, cost rates can vary depending on the task. For example, a staffer's cost rate is higher for a programming task than an editorial one. To account for this, custom cost rates can be set up for each staffer on their Staff Dashboard. The cost rate set up on the Staff Dashboard is applied as a rule when staffers log time to any task.

332,Permissions/User Rights,Security: Create Staff Departments With Managerial Rights,"Topic: Organizing Staffers into Departments and Granting Management Authority
Solution: Use Staff Department values to organize your staffers into departments, such as sales or editorial. Grant specific staffers management authority over these departments, allowing them to view, edit, and/or approve time and expenses logged by staffers in the department(s) they oversee.

To effectively manage your team, it's important to organize your staffers into departments based on their roles and responsibilities. This can be done by creating Staff Department values, such as sales or editorial, and assigning each staffer to a specific department.

Once your staffers are organized into departments, it's important to grant specific staffers management authority over these departments. This allows them to oversee the work of other staffers in their department, view their time and expenses, and make necessary edits or approvals.

For example, if you have a staffer named Zach who is responsible for overseeing the editorial and writing departments, you can grant him management authority over these departments. This will allow him to view, edit, and/or approve time and expenses logged by staffers in both departments.

To implement this system in your own organization, start by creating Staff Department values and assigning each staffer to a specific department. Then, identify which staffers should be granted management authority over each department and make the necessary adjustments to your team's structure.

By organizing your staffers into departments and granting management authority to specific individuals, you can streamline your team's workflow and ensure that everyone is working together towards a common goal.",295

396,Project Management,Using Resource Allocation Reports: Allocation Detail by Staffer,"Topic: Using Resource Allocation Reports: Allocation Detail by Staffer

Solution: The article provides a guide on how to use the Allocation Detail by Staffer report to keep track of the time allocated to each staffer and the hours they inputted during a specific period. The report helps to identify which staffers repeatedly exceed their budgeted number of hours and may cause the entire project to go over budget, which can put an unanticipated financial burden on the client. The report also helps to identify if a project is taking much more time than anticipated and multiple staffers are exceeding their budgets. In either case, it is a good idea to contact the client and talk about allocating more hours to the project. The report can be adjusted to view the inputted hours by staffer on a weekly or monthly basis, which is helpful during mid-month reviews, so changes can be made before the month ends. The report also gives a chance to look forward and think about how staffers should use their time.",194
397,Project Management,Using Resource Allocation Reports: Allocation by Month/Staffer,"Topic: Using Resource Allocation Reports: Allocation by Month/Staffer
Solution: The Allocation by Month/Staffer report in BigTime allows you to see which staff members are allocated to which projects over several months.

This article will provide an overview of all three options and offer scenarios for when to use them. Additionally, we will direct you to specific articles that explain each option step-by-step. 

Deleting a project is a permanent action and should only be done if you are sure you no longer need the project or any of its associated data. Deactivating a project is a temporary action that allows you to hide the project from your list without deleting any data. Merging a project with another project combines the data from both projects into one. 

When deciding which option to use, consider the specific needs of your project and the data associated with it. If you are unsure, consult the step-by-step articles we have provided for each option.",187
399,Project Management,Delete a Project,"Topic: Deleting a Project in BigTime

Solution: Deleting a project in BigTime is a permanent action that removes the project and all its data from the system. However, there may be situations where you want to delete a project, such as when a contract falls through. In such cases, you can delete the project or deactivate it if it may work out in the future. 

It is important to note that BigTime will not allow you to delete a project that has transactions associated with it. If you try to delete such a project, BigTime will ask if you are sure you want to delete it. When you click ""yes,"" it will give you an error message that lists the number of transactions you have on the project, such as time entries, expenses, and invoices. Therefore, it is recommended to review all transactions associated with a project before attempting to delete it.",177
400,Project Management,Deactivate a Project,"Topic: Deactivating a Project in BigTime
Solution: Deactivating a project in BigTime is a simple process that allows users to remove completed or on-hold projects from their Project List, while still retaining project data for future reactivation. To deactivate a project, follow these steps:

Select the deactivation date by clicking into the ""DEACTIVATION DATE"" box and selecting a date from the calendar. Keep in mind that deactivating a project prevents users from entering and editing allocations for this project. Allocations that are passed that selected date will not show up on allocation reports or the utilization dashboard.
6. Click ""DEACTIVATE"" to deactivate your project, and you'll get a notice that you deactivated your project.

Deactivating a project in BigTime is an easy way to keep the Project List clear and filled only with active projects, while still retaining project data for future reactivation.",316

402,Project Management,Selecting a BigTime Display Name,"Topic: Understanding Display Names in BigTime Projects
Solution: This article explains that the name displayed on screen for a project in BigTime is not the same as the value in the project name field. Instead, it is the project's display name, which can be automatically updated and may include additional information such as a client name or project code. The article provides instructions for updating the display name settings in your system.",83
403,Project Management,Whats a Display Name?,"Topic: Understanding Display Names in BigTime

Solution: Display names in BigTime are a way to customize how project information is displayed on reports, timesheets, and other screens. By default, the display name is set up as client:project, which means that the client's name and project name will be shown together. However, BigTime also supports several options for automatically computing display names, including options for flat project lists and hierarchical lists.

To set up display name settings in BigTime, go to the Display Name Settings section. Here, you can choose from several display name examples, such as Client:PRJID ProjectName or Client:ProjectName - PRJID. You can also create your own custom display name by selecting the CLIENTID, ClientName, ProjectName, or PRJID variables and combining them in a way that makes sense for your organization.

For example, if your client is C&H Software and your project is Site Development, the default display name would be C&H Software: Site Development. However, you could also choose to display the project ID in the display name, such as C&H Software: Site Development - MST-16-0148.

Overall, understanding display names in BigTime can help you customize how project information is displayed and make it easier to identify and track projects.",268
404,Project Management,Hierarchical Display Names,"Topic: The Importance of Hierarchical Display Names in Reports
Solution: By replacing the ""Project Name"" column with a ""Project Display Name"" field, reports can provide clearer and more accurate information, especially when dealing with multiple projects with the same name.

When creating reports that contain columns with identical names, it can be difficult to determine which data corresponds to which project. This is where hierarchical display names come in. By replacing the ""Project Name"" column with a ""Project Display Name"" field, reports can provide clearer and more accurate information.

For example, imagine a report that contains budget data for three projects with the same name for three different clients. Without hierarchical display names, it would be difficult to determine which project is in trouble. However, by using hierarchical display names, the report can clearly show which service agreement needs attention. 

In the example provided, the report displays the budget data for three projects with the same name for three different clients. By replacing the ""Project Name"" column with a ""Project Display Name"" field, the report can clearly show which service agreement needs attention. The service agreement for Mole Station is the one in trouble, as it has a negative budget remaining. This demonstrates why hierarchical display names are important in reports.

In conclusion, hierarchical display names are crucial in reports, especially when dealing with multiple projects with the same name. By using hierarchical display names, reports can provide clearer and more accurate information, making it easier to identify and address issues.",297
405,Project Management,TIP: Lookups Use a Projects Display Name.,"Topic: Importance of Using a Project's Display Name for Lookups
Solution: When using lookups in a system, it is important to use a project's display name as all search fields are keyed from it. This is especially crucial for firms with numerous active projects.

4. Update your display name setting using the picklist and then click the ""SAVE"" button in the columns footer.
5. Finally, click the ""UPDATE TIMESHEET FORMAT"" button at the top of the settings page. Each of your projects' display names will be adjusted based on your new selection. You can update your display name settings as many times as you need to by repeating these steps, and BigTime will update your data each time.",242
407,Project Management,Creating an Internal Project,"Topic: Setting up an internal project for non-billable time

414,Project Management,Deleting/Deactivating a Project,"Topic: Deactivating and Deleting Projects in BigTime

Solution: This article explains the difference between deactivating and deleting a project in BigTime, and provides instructions on how to use each option. Note that only Premier users can deactivate projects.

First, let's define what deactivating and deleting mean in BigTime. Deactivating a project changes its status from active to inactive on your Project Dashboard. This removes the project from your Project List, but the data, such as time and billing history, are saved. You cannot enter or edit allocations for a deactivated project. However, if the project is still on the timesheet, time can continue to be added unless a due date is established for that project. Reactivating a deactivated project is easy.

Deleting a project is a permanent action that removes the project and associated data from BigTime. However, you cannot delete a project that has transactions associated with it without first removing the transactions. Deleting a project is a permanent action that cannot be undone.

To use these options, first, log in to your BigTime account. Then, navigate to the Project Dashboard and select the project you want to deactivate or delete. To deactivate a project, click on the ""Deactivate"" button. To reactivate a project, click on the ""Reactivate"" button. To delete a project, click on the ""Delete"" button. If the project has transactions associated with it, you will need to remove them before you can delete the project.

In conclusion, deactivating and deleting a project in BigTime are two different actions with different consequences. Deactivating a project is a temporary solution that saves data, while deleting a project is a permanent solution that removes all associated data.",347

560,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Intro to Recurring Tasks,"Topic: Introduction to Recurring Tasks
Solution: This article provides an introduction to recurring tasks, including the components of recurring tasks, the benefits of using recurring tasks, and how to create a recurring task.

Recurring tasks are tasks that need to be completed on a regular basis, such as weekly, monthly, or quarterly. By creating a recurring task, you can save time and ensure that the task is completed consistently and efficiently.

The components of a recurring task include the task itself, the frequency of the task, and the start and end dates of the task. When creating a recurring task, it is important to consider the frequency of the task and the duration of the task.

There are several benefits to using recurring tasks. First, recurring tasks can save time by eliminating the need to enter the same task multiple times. Second, recurring tasks can help ensure that tasks are completed consistently and on time. Finally, recurring tasks can help you stay organized and on top of your workload.

To create a recurring task, you can use a task management tool or software. Simply enter the task, set the frequency and duration, and specify the start and end dates. Once the recurring task is created, it will automatically appear on your task list at the specified frequency.

In conclusion, recurring tasks are a useful tool for managing projects and clients. By understanding the components of recurring tasks, the benefits of using recurring tasks, and how to create a recurring task, you can save time, stay organized, and ensure that tasks are completed consistently and efficiently.",307
561,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Components of Recurring Tasks,"Topic: Components of Recurring Tasks
Solution: Recurring tasks work like a recurring meeting in a calendar app, with a series master record for the task and individual records for each occurrence. The series master contains information about the task and stores task-related hours, expenses, and invoicing data. The budget on the series master should be the calculated total for the series. Occurrences can be edited at the occurrence level or within the series master, but deleting a single occurrence does not delete the entire series. Start and end dates have nuances to be aware of, with the start date being non-retroactive and the end date being editable. Changing the due date on a single occurrence will not change the end date on the master series. It is important to exercise caution with start and end dates to avoid closing the recurring task prematurely. The task type cannot be changed on a recurring task, but the status can be updated.",184
562,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Why Use Recurring Tasks?,"Topic: Benefits of Using Recurring Tasks
Solution: Recurring tasks are a useful tool for tracking and managing due dates for regularly occurring or ongoing work. By using recurring tasks, you can avoid the hassle of manually entering the same task and task-related details each week or month. 

When you create a recurring task, it is automatically assigned to an individual for a specific due date. Once the staffer marks one task in the recurring task series as complete, the Task Dashboard will queue up the next one. This ensures that tasks are completed on time and nothing falls through the cracks.

Another advantage of recurring tasks is that you can easily change staff assignments from one task occurrence within a series to another. This allows for flexibility in managing tasks and ensures that the right person is assigned to each task.

Finally, you can also report on each occurrence within a series from the Report Center. This provides valuable insights into task completion rates and helps you identify any areas that may need improvement.

Overall, using recurring tasks can help streamline your workflow and ensure that tasks are completed on time and efficiently.",215
563,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,TIP: Use Recurring Tasks for Managing Deadlines,"Topic: Using Recurring Tasks for Managing Deadlines
Solution: Recurring tasks are a useful project management tool for tracking regular deadlines. However, they should not be used for managing budgets as transaction data is only stored at the series master level, making it difficult to capture budget data on an occurrence-by-occurrence level. To effectively manage deadlines using recurring tasks, it is important to set clear deadlines and prioritize tasks based on their importance. Additionally, regularly reviewing and updating the task list can help ensure that deadlines are met and projects stay on track.",110
564,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Due Dates and Task Assignments,"Topic: Importance of Setting Due Dates and Assigning Staffers to Tasks in Project Management
Solution: By setting due dates and assigning staffers to tasks, project managers can effectively communicate deadlines to their team and allocate work to different staff members. This article will provide guidance on how to set due dates, make and change staffer assignments on tasks, and view unassigned or pool tasks.

Effective project management requires careful planning and organization. One key aspect of this is setting due dates and assigning staffers to tasks. By doing so, project managers can ensure that their team is aware of deadlines and that work is distributed evenly among team members.

To set due dates, project managers should first establish a project timeline. This timeline should include all major milestones and deadlines. Once the timeline is established, due dates can be assigned to individual tasks based on their priority and complexity.

Assigning staffers to tasks is also an important part of project management. This ensures that work is distributed evenly among team members and that everyone has a clear understanding of their responsibilities. To assign staffers to tasks, project managers should consider each team member's skills and availability. They should also communicate clearly with team members about their assignments and any changes that may occur.

In addition to setting due dates and assigning staffers to tasks, project managers should also be able to view unassigned or pool tasks. This allows them to identify tasks that have not yet been assigned and ensure that all work is being completed on schedule.

In conclusion, setting due dates and assigning staffers to tasks is crucial for effective project management. By following the guidelines outlined in this article, project managers can ensure that their team is aware of deadlines, work is distributed evenly, and all tasks are completed on schedule.",341

4. Click ""SAVE"" to update the task record.",152
566,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Tasks Can Change Hands Throughout Their Lifetime,"Topic: Managing Task Workflows in BigTime

Solution: BigTime makes it easy to manage task workflows by creating workflows for different types of tasks. Tasks can be assigned to different members of the project team as they are completed, and each time a task moves from one stage to the next, there is an opportunity to hand it off to another staffer.

Solution: Managers and administrators can view upcoming due dates and staff assignments on all tasks. They can use the Due Date filter to narrow down due dates by selecting the tile for overdue tasks and tasks due today, this week, or this month. In addition, they can take a look at how an individual staffer's schedule looks by selecting the staffer from the Assignments filter. This will help provide a picture of staffers who might be overextended, which might assist with redistributing tasks. Staffers will see only the tasks to which they are assigned and unassigned tasks under a given project (if they are a part of that project team). They can use the Due Date filter to keep track of their upcoming due dates.",152
568,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Viewing Unassigned Tasks,"Topic: Using Pool Tasks in Project Management
Solution: Pool tasks are a useful tool in project management that allow any member of a project team to work on unassigned tasks. However, in order to take advantage of pool tasks, project teams must be utilized. If pool tasks are created on a project with no team members assigned to it, only system administrators or users with task administrator rights will be able to see them from the Unassigned bucket. By using project teams and assigning members to tasks, pool tasks can be a great way to let the entire project team work on every task in the system.",120

Solution: In order for a task to appear on a user's timesheet in BigTime, it needs to be assigned to the staff member. Unassigned tasks, also known as ""pool tasks,"" will appear for each project team member. However, once a task is marked as completed, it will no longer show up in a staffer's picklists. It is important to note that the tasks users see in picklists and throughout BigTime will always include task assignments. By assigning tasks to staff members, you can ensure that they only see the tasks that are relevant to them on their timesheets.",139

588,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Budget Status Tracking,"Topic: Monitoring Project Budget Status
Solution: Utilizing BigTime Reports and Invoicing Features

After creating project budgets, it is important to monitor their status to ensure that they are on track and within the allocated budget. One way to do this is by utilizing BigTime reports, which can provide real-time updates on the budget status of each project. Additionally, certain invoicing features can be used to ensure that the data is updated and reflected on both the task and reporting levels. By regularly monitoring the budget status and utilizing these tools, firms can stay on top of their project finances and make necessary adjustments to ensure success.",125
589,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,How Submitting Time and Expenses Impacts Budget Status,"Topic: The Importance of Time and Expense Submission in BigTime Workflow
Solution: Time and expense submission plays a crucial role in invoicing, managing project budgets, and overall workflow in BigTime. Hours and expenses submitted and approved against tasks can be used to update budgets and invoice clients, which impacts the estimates set on hours and charges for tasks. Any progress on task estimates also affects the overall status of the project budget. To establish time and expense workflows, use the following helpful resources: The Timesheet Workflow, Customizing Your Timesheet, Timesheet Review and Approval, Expense Tracking Workflow, Customizing Expense Entry, and Expense Review and Approval.",129
590,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Invoicing and Budget Status,"Topic: Invoicing and Budget Status
Solution: When creating invoices in BigTime, it is important to understand how project budgets are created at the task level and how to accurately reflect invoiced amounts against the budget. 

For Time and Materials (T&M) Invoices, it is necessary to subtotal by tasks in order to accurately reflect the invoiced amount against the estimate. Failure to do so will result in the invoiced amount not being reflected against the budget total on invoicing history or reports. To learn more about creating T&M invoices and how to arrive at the subtotaling area, read Creating Time/Materials Invoices.

Fixed-fee Invoices are only possible to issue when a budget is in place. The options that appear when drafting invoices will directly impact task details. You can set an invoice amount according to milestones or task percent completion, which will automatically update that field within the task detail. To learn more about how the percent complete field relates to archiving tasks and creating percent complete invoices, read about it in the article.

Additionally, budget information can be displayed on PDF invoices. To learn how to add billing progress to your print invoice, read the article on adding billing progress.",241
591,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Reporting on Budget Status,"Topic: Reporting on Budget Status
Solution: BigTime offers out-of-the-box reports about tasks that can be customized to show time, expense, and invoicing activity and their impact on task estimate status. These reports can include metrics such as Total Input, Charges Remaining (Est-Billable Charges), and Hours Remaining (Est-Input Hours or Est-Billable Hours) to reflect time and expense activity against task estimates. Invoicing history can also affect task-related reports, and if your firm reflects budget status on invoices, you can include fields like Charges Remaining (Est-Total Invoiced) or Total Invoiced on task reports. There are various fields that can be included or excluded on task reports, and users can refer to the Reporting on Tasks and Creating Custom Reports guides to get started.",162
592,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Setting Up and Managing Your Task Workflow,"Topic: Establishing a Workflow for Task Progress Reporting

594,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Defining a Tasks Progress Through Each Stage Using Status Codes,"Topic: Defining Task Progress Using Status Codes

Solution: One effective way to track the progress of a task is by using status codes. Status codes are labels that indicate the current stage of a task. By assigning a unique code to each stage of the task, it becomes easier to track its progress and identify any issues that may arise.

To use status codes effectively, it is important to define what each code represents. For example, a code of ""In Progress"" could indicate that the task is currently being worked on, while a code of ""On Hold"" could indicate that the task has been paused for some reason.

It is also important to ensure that everyone involved in the task is aware of the status codes and what they mean. This can be achieved through clear communication and documentation.

By using status codes to track task progress, teams can stay organized and ensure that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.",181
595,Tracking Tasks and Budgets,Editing Stages,"Topic: Editing Stages in BigTime

629,Resource Planning,What Is Capacity?,"Topic: Capacity in BigTime
Solution: Capacity is the number of hours a staffer is expected to work in a month. In BigTime, this number is usually 160 hours per month, based on the average full-time staffer working 40 hours each week for four weeks each month. However, this number can be adjusted by typing into the capacity text box. 

To determine if your staffers are being over or under utilized, compare the number of hours they work to their capacity. For example, if a staffer worked 200 hours last month, they are over capacity. In this case, you can allocate some work to a staffer who worked fewer hours and is under capacity. 

You can also see a staffer's daily capacity on the timesheets. This can help you determine if they are working billable hours and if they are working long or short days. By adding capacity to timesheets, you can get answers to these questions.",188

684,Resource Planning,Allocate Budgets by Week or Month in Resource Allocation,"Topic: Resource Allocation in BigTime
Solution: This article explains the benefits of allocating budgets by week or month in resource allocation in BigTime and how to toggle between them.

When it comes to resource allocation in BigTime, you have the option to allocate budgets by week or month. The decision on which to choose is firm-dependent, as there are benefits to both. However, regardless of your choice, you can run resource allocation reports at both the weekly and monthly level.

Allocating budgets by week allows for more granular control over your resources and can help you identify any issues or inefficiencies on a more frequent basis. On the other hand, allocating budgets by month can provide a higher-level overview of your resources and can be more useful for long-term planning.

To toggle between the two allocation types in BigTime, simply go to the resource allocation section and select the desired time frame. It's important to note that this article assumes you already know how to access resource allocation in BigTime.

In summary, when it comes to resource allocation in BigTime, you have the option to allocate budgets by week or month, each with their own benefits. By toggling between the two, you can gain a more comprehensive understanding of your resources and make more informed decisions.",253
685,Resource Planning,Weekly vs Monthly Allocations,"Topic: Weekly vs Monthly Allocations
Solution: Consider the details below to help guide your decision to allocate your budgets by week or month. 

When deciding whether to allocate budgets by week or month, it's important to consider the duration of your projects and the level of detail you need to track. Weekly allocations are ideal for shorter projects that last less than 12 weeks and offer a detailed view of your business and staffers. This level of detail can help prevent costly errors, like exceeding budgets, and is helpful for companies that want to closely monitor their resources, such as staffers' time.

On the other hand, monthly allocations are a good option for projects with longer durations and larger teams. They provide a more global view of your business and can easily integrate with firms that already follow a month-to-month schedule for setting goals, tracking metrics, and delegating assignments.

Ultimately, the decision to allocate budgets by week or month depends on the specific needs of your business and projects. By considering the details outlined above, you can make an informed decision that will help you effectively manage your resources and achieve your goals.",221

695,Resource Planning,Why Use The Planning Board?,"Topic: The Importance of a Watertight Resource Planning Strategy

Solution: Successful firms plan for projects weeks, even months ahead of time. They allocate future hours and tasks to the right staffers, ensuring that everyone is working at their capacity and distributing workloads evenly. However, without the right tools, making that kind of strategy a reality can get messy. Firms that take a low-tech approach to resource planning will need to create multiple reports and run their data side by side to figure out how to allocate hours. That translates to a lot of open tabs, and a lot of valuable time wasted on mental math and manual data analysis. 

To solve these logistical problems, BigTime developed a feature called the Planning Board. This tool gives BigTime users a holistic view of all their staffers' future allocations. The Planning Board can be accessed by going to ""WORKFLOW"" on the main navigation bar and clicking ""PLANNING BOARD"". Once in the Planning Board window, system administrators (or users with Planning Board permissions) can see all their staffers' future allocations in a weekly or monthly view. By clicking on staffer names, they can drill down into their allocations for each project. Visual tools like donut charts and color coding give immediate insight into whether staffers are over or under allocated. There are also sorting, grouping, and filtering options available so firm leaders can organize their Planning Board data in the way that works best for them.

The Planning Board makes sense out of raw allocation data and paints a clearer picture of the health of your firm's resource planning strategy. Leveraging it can help your firm stay focused on the future.",325

The table has six columns under the HOURS header, each correlating to either a weekly or monthly allocation amount. The cells in the HOURS columns are color-coded to reflect whether a staffer is under, over, or exactly allocated for the time period in question. The Planning Board also has options to change the time periods shown, toggle between HOURS and PERCENTAGES, and export to PDF. The sidebar on the left side of the window has filtering options for projects and staff. The button on the top right side of the window allows for adjusting groupings on the Planning Board. If there are any questions, there are articles available to help answer them.",182
698,Resource Planning,A Tour of Your Planning Board,"Topic: Understanding the Planning Board

Solution: The Planning Board is a tool that displays a list of all staffers, their respective capacities, and their hourly allocations for a selected time frame. The table has six columns under the ""HOURS"" header, each one correlating to either a weekly or monthly allocation amount.

699,Resource Planning,Planning Board User Permissions,"Topic: User Permissions for Accessing and Editing the Planning Board in BigTime

Solution: In order to access and make edits to the Planning Board in BigTime, users must have specific user permissions.

The article also suggests taking a closer look at how the percent values in each chart are calculated.",117
702,Resource Planning,% Under Allocated,"Topic: Understanding % Under Allocated in BigTime Planning Board
Solution: % Under Allocated represents the percentage of staffers who are allocated below their set hourly capacity in the BigTime Planning Board. To calculate this value, BigTime takes the total number of staffers displayed on the Planning Board and divides it by the number of under-allocated staffers. For example, if you have 50 total staffers displayed on your Planning Board and 8 of them are under-allocated, the % Under Allocated value would be 16%. This value is displayed on the UNDER ALLOCATED donut chart.",119
703,Resource Planning,% Over Allocated,"Topic: Understanding the Planning Board Charts

708,Resource Planning,FAQ: The Planning Board,"Topic: Accessing and Using the Planning Board

Solution: 
To access the Planning Board, navigate to the ""WORKFLOW"" tab on your main navigation bar, and click ""PLANNING BOARD"" from the dropdown menu that appears. In order for a user to access the Planning Board, they will need to have been granted all the same user rights that they need to access the Utilization dashboard. These permissions include ""Reporting: All Access,"" ""Access Task Budget Data,"" and ""View/Manage Any Staff Member."" Each of these user permissions can be turned on from your security group settings (""MY COMPANY…USER RIGHTS""). Once you have turned on all the appropriate permissions for your chosen security group, make sure the staffer you want to access your planning board has been added to that security group.

If you have allocated future hours to your staffers, you will see the rows next to each of their names highlighted either in yellow, red, or white. When a cell in a staffer's allocated hours row is highlighted yellow, that indicates they are underallocated for that time period. A red highlight means that staffer is overallocated for that time period, and if a cell is white, that means their allocations match their capacity. These highlights are designed to help you better see which staffers' allocations need attention or adjustment.

The donut charts at the top of your window give you a sense of your total allocation stats across all your staffers for the six time periods (either weeks or days) displayed on your planning board. Each donut chart displays a percent value. The percentage in the ""UNDER ALLOCATED"" chart is calculated by dividing your total number of staffers by the number of staffers not allocated at their full capacity. The percentage in your ""OVER ALLOCATED"" chart is calculated by dividing your number of total staffers by the number of staffers who are allocated over their capacity. Both of these donut charts are meant to give you a wider perspective of how you have been handling resource allocation firm-wide.

Note that you won't be able to make edits to staffer allocations in the Planning Board. You will need to navigate back to the allocation editor for a specific project to make any desired changes. To do so, click the hyperlinked name of the staffer whose allocations you'd like to edit. This will expand a list of all the projects that staffer has been allocated toward. Click one of these project names will take you to that project's allocation editor, where you can make your changes.",498

System admins can create security groups and grant access privileges to specific staffers within the ""User Rights"" window. Under the ""Skills"" category, there are two subcategories: ""Skill List"" and ""Staff Skills."" The ""Skill List"" category covers user rights needed to take actions within the Skill List, such as viewing and managing it, and allowing users to delete skills. The ""Staff Skills"" category contains user rights needed to access and manage skills for other staffers, such as viewing and managing staff skills, and allowing users to remove staff skills. System admins can configure skills-specific user rights in any way that makes sense for their firm, such as granting the finance team the ability to view the firm's skill list without the ability to edit or delete skills. The settings for any security group can be opened at any time to turn skills permissions on or off, depending on the firm's needs.",218

When adding a new skill, it is important to fill out the ""Skill Name"" field. This field is where you can add the name you will use to refer to your skill. It is a required field, so you will not be able to add your skill unless you fill it out.

By filling out the ""Skill Name"" field, you are giving your skill a clear and concise name that will make it easier to find and reference in the future. This is especially important if you have multiple skills listed.

In addition, making the ""Skill Name"" field a required field ensures that all skills listed have a name, making it easier for others to understand what each skill is and what it entails.

In summary, be sure to fill out the ""Skill Name"" field when adding a new skill to ensure that it has a clear and concise name and is easily identifiable.",213
727,Skills Matching,Skill Type,"Topic: The importance of the SKILL TYPE field when adding skills to a profile.

When you click the gray arrow, you will be able to choose from a dropdown picklist with the following options: SKILL, CERTIFICATION, LANGUAGE, or OTHER. For example, if you want to indicate that a staffer is fluent in Spanish, you could add ""Spanish"" as a skill and make ""Language"" the skill type. If a staffer has completed a specific course and received a certification, the skill type field would allow you to account for that certification. By using the SKILL TYPE field correctly, you can ensure that your profile accurately reflects the skills and qualifications of the individual.",163

732,Invoicing,Description,"Topic: Using the Description Field to Add Extra Information to a Skill

Solution: The DESCRIPTION field is the last field in the ADD SKILL window and can be used to add extra information about a skill that is not reflected in any of the other fields. This field allows you to write full sentences to fill out any extra information about your skill. Additionally, the description column can be used to describe a line item and set a condition. Think of a condition as a rule: if the condition is true, then apply the line item. For example, if you want to add a deposit line item only when the deposit is less than $10,000, you can add a description, such as ""Deposit,"" to the description column and then click on the hyperlink ""add condition"" to clarify the line item. This will ensure that $10,000 is only added to the deposit when the deposit is less than $10,000.",187

757,Tracking Time,Entered vs. Submitted,"Topic: The Importance of Timesheet Submission in BigTime

Solution: In BigTime, there are two required steps for any timesheet: entry and submission. All time begins as an entered value, which is referred to as ""input"" time. However, users can change these values throughout the week, which can make invoicing and running payroll a challenge. To combat this, BigTime implements a timesheet submission process, which requires each user to regularly submit their timesheet electronically. Once a time entry is submitted, it cannot be edited. Before time can be posted or invoiced, it must be submitted. Since submitted time cannot be edited or deleted by the user, BigTime's billing and payroll screens are usually based on submitted time. Therefore, it is important for users to regularly submit their timesheets to ensure accurate invoicing and payroll processing.",171
758,Tracking Time,"""Unapproved, Approved, or Rejected""","Topic: BigTime's Approval Workflow
Solution: BigTime's approval workflow allows managers to review and approve time submissions, ensuring accuracy and detail in hours for easier payroll and billing. All submitted time starts as unapproved, with rejected time being routed back to the user for adjustments. Only approved time will make it to an invoice or payroll system. More information on review and approvals can be found in later sections.",82
759,Tracking Time,Input vs. Billable/Billed,"Topic: Understanding Input vs. Billable/Billed Time in BigTime Invoicing Features
Solution: BigTime's invoicing features allow users to distinguish between input time and billable/billed time. While all entries are considered input time, only time that is marked as billable will eventually be billed back to a client. Once billable time is included on an invoice, it is considered billed or invoiced. This distinction is important for project managers who want to track the status of project budgets and for billing managers/partners who are concerned with the budget vs. billable time ratios on a project. BigTime supports both of these functions, making it a helpful tool for managing projects and invoicing clients.",143
760,Tracking Time,Marking Time Up/Down,"Topic: Marking Time Up/Down
Solution: The article discusses how the distinction between input and billable time becomes more complicated when time is marked down. Once time has been submitted, managers have the ability to change the billable portion of an entry. Each time entry could have a different hours value, depending on the nature of the content that a given screen/report is attempting to show. For example, a 2 hour entry that gets marked as non-billable has an input hours value of 2, but a billable hours value of 0. This feature allows teams to write down hours or bill for a portion of each hourly entry to account for training time or other special factors. BigTime will always keep track of the entered amount of hours and show the billable time that was actually applied during these adjustments.",167
761,Tracking Time,Unposted vs. Posted,"Topic: Posting Time in BigTime and Accounting Packages
Solution: When integrating BigTime with an accounting application like QuickBooks, firms can post BigTime's hours into the accounting system for payroll or invoicing purposes. However, it's important to note that the input hourly total for a given period may be different than the hourly totals in the accounting package. This is because the input hours include both posted and unposted time, while only the posted hours are stored in the accounting package. To ensure accuracy, firms should always check that the total posted hours match the input hours, and keep in mind that billable values are only stored in BigTime.",130

Solution: BigTime can automatically apply a payroll item to an employee's timesheet, reducing human error and allowing for exceptions to be made for special case scenarios like vacation.

BigTime offers a solution to firms looking to reduce human error when it comes to selecting payroll items for their employees.

This feature is available through BigTime. 

In this article, we will discuss how to access multi-level approvals, who can approve time and expenses, and what the multi-level approval workflow looks like. Multi-level approvals are an essential tool for catching small but costly mistakes, such as erroneous time entries. By having multiple levels of review, you can ensure that all time and expenses are accurately billed to clients and properly recorded in your accounting system. 

To access multi-level approvals, you must be a Premier subscriber with BigTime. Pro level users get one level of approval. Once you have access, you can decide who reviews your staffers' submissions and when they're reviewed. For example, Company A has a team lead, manager, and a finance administrator review a staffer's time and expenses. Company B has a manager and financial administrator review them. 

The multi-level approval workflow begins with the staffer submitting their time and expenses. The first level of approval will review the submission and either approve or reject it. If rejected, the staffer will need to make the necessary changes and resubmit. If approved, the submission will move on to the next level of approval. This process continues until all levels of approval have been completed. 

In conclusion, multi-level approvals are an essential tool for ensuring accurate billing and accounting of time and expenses.

912,Tracking Expenses,Assigning User Roles To Review/Approve Expenses,"Topic: Assigning User Roles To Review/Approve Expenses
Solution: The article provides two solutions for assigning user roles to review and approve expenses. The first solution involves assigning staff to specific projects and assigning a Project Team Lead who has the right to review and approve expenses for other team members on the project.

If you want to invoice the full amount of billable expenses, this will generate line items separate from the Task fixed amount. Now the expenses will be summarized by Expense category instead of being lumped under the Task.
8. Clicking the ""FINALIZE"" button saves the draft, but you may continue to edit the invoice until you're ready to send it. When ready, you may print your invoice, email it to your client, or post it to QuickBooks. And that brings the Expense Tracking workflow full circle.",381

916,Tracking Expenses,Non-Reimbursable Expenses,"Topic: Non-Reimbursable Expenses
Solution: This article explains what non-reimbursable expenses are and provides a step-by-step guide on how to add a charge for such expenses.

Non-reimbursable expenses are expenses that are incurred on a corporate credit card, but the employee does not receive any payment. For example, if an employee uses their corporate credit card to pay for their hotel, food, and transportation while on a business trip, they will not receive any reimbursement for these expenses.

To add a charge for non-reimbursable expenses, follow these steps:

2. Click on the white triangle next to ""ADD NEW EXPENSE"" and select ""ADD CHARGE"" from the picklist.

The third-party will send you a bill, which you can log as a vendor expense in BigTime. This allows you to keep track of all project-related expenses and ensures that you are accurately accounting for all costs associated with the project.",132

- Sales Rate: If the selected expense code is configured to be a unit of measure, then this field will be enabled and the user can enter a custom sales rate for this project. Otherwise, this field will be disabled. Sales rates are applied on the expense when it gets added to an invoice.

1009,Tracking Expenses,Your Expense Options,"Topic: Expense Types in BigTime
Solution: BigTime offers three expense types: ADD EXPENSE, ADD CHARGE, and ADD VENDOR EXPENSE. 

BigTime provides three expense types for users to choose from: ADD EXPENSE, ADD CHARGE, and ADD VENDOR EXPENSE. ADD EXPENSE is a reimbursable expense, meaning that the employee will be reimbursed for their expenses. For instance, if an employee uses their personal credit card to pay for a client dinner, they can use the ""ADD EXPENSE"" option in BigTime to create an expense report and get paid back for the dinner costs. 

On the other hand, ADD CHARGE is a non-reimbursable expense. If an employee uses their corporate card to pay for a conference and hotel accommodations, they won't be reimbursed since the charges were incurred on their corporate card. However, they can use the ""ADD CHARGE"" option in BigTime to log their charges. 

Lastly, vendor expenses are expenses associated with a project and submitted as a bill from a vendor. For example, if an engineering company is working on a project that requires a specific type of concrete, they may hire a third party to advise and provide materials before using it. The third-party will send a bill, which can be logged as a vendor expense in BigTime.",272

1181,Invoicing,FAQ: Invoice Auto-Numbering,"Topic: Invoice Auto-Numbering Formatting Options
Solution: 

You can control the format of your invoice numbers by entering a formatting code in your invoice configuration settings. The auto-numbering format code follows a lettering system, with each letter corresponding to a different value. The available options are:

- C = Client ID
- Y = Year
- M = Month
- P = Auto Increment Number
- T = Project Type
- R = Project ID

To include a client's three-digit ID on your invoices, set your invoice auto-numbering format as ""CCC"", since the letter C corresponds to your client ID.

To include the month in your invoice number, configure the auto-numbering system to display the month by entering ""M"" in the auto-numbering format settings field. You have two options when it comes to displaying the month in an invoice number: you can show the month as a number, or as the first three letters of the month name. For example, if you've created an invoice in August and want the auto-numbering format to be by month, you could enter ""MM"", which would display the month as ""08"". You could also enter ""MMM"", which would display ""AUG"" on your invoice.

When you add a value to the ""NEXT ID"" field, you only need to set it up if you plan to include an auto-increment value (represented by the letter ""P"") in your auto-numbering format. For instance, if you want your invoice to display the year and an incremental value, set your auto-numbering format as ""YYPPP"". If you want your first invoice number to start with ""23"" (the year your invoices are created) followed by ""100"", enter ""100"" in your NEXT ID field. BigTime will automatically create your first invoice with ""23100"" as the number, and will adjust that number for all following invoices. Your second invoice number would be ""23101"", and your third would be ""23102"", and so on.

Any incremental value generated by BigTime will apply to all invoices you create. If you're using the Project ID in your auto-numbering format and the entire ID isn't showing in the invoice number, make sure the number of ""Rs"" in your ""FORMAT"" field matches the number of digits in your project ID. 

If you delete an invoice, your NEXT ID number won't change, and there will just be a gap in your numbering. If you don't want to have any gaps in your invoice numbering, go change your NEXT ID to reflect that in your invoice configuration settings.

To ensure you don't have duplicate invoice numbers, check the box labeled ""ENFORCE UNIQUE INVOICE NUMBER"" in your invoice configuration settings.",557
1182,Invoicing,FAQ: Invoice Auto-Numbering,"Topic: Auto-Numbering Invoices in BigTime

Solution: To set up auto-numbering for your invoices in BigTime, you can use the NEXT ID field to specify the starting number for your invoices. If you want to include an incremental value in your auto-numbering format, you can enter it after the starting number. However, the incremental value will apply to all invoices you create and cannot be customized for individual clients or projects. 

If you are using the Project ID in your auto-numbering format and the entire ID is not showing in the invoice number, make sure the number of Rs in your FORMAT field matches the number of digits in your project ID. 

If you delete an invoice, the NEXT ID number will not change, resulting in a gap in your numbering. To avoid gaps, you can change your NEXT ID to reflect the deleted invoice in your invoice configuration settings. 

To ensure you don't have duplicate invoice numbers, check the box labeled ENFORCE UNIQUE INVOICE NUMBER in your invoice configuration settings.",206
1183,Invoicing,Set Up Invoice Auto-Numbering,"Topic: How to adjust auto-numbering settings for invoices in BigTimes invoicing software.

Solution: To adjust your auto-numbering settings for your invoices in BigTimes invoicing software, follow these steps:

1. Go to INVOICING…CONFIGURE from your main navigation menu.
2. In the CONFIGURE INVOICE SETTINGS window, click on the DEFAULTS tab and find the INVOICE AUTO-NUMBER SETTINGS section.
3. The FORMAT field in this section will allow you to edit the format your invoice numbers are created and displayed in. Formats in this field follow a lettering system, and you can hover over the QUESTION MARK icon to learn more about what each letter stands for. For example, C stands for Client ID, Y stands for Year, M stands for Month, P stands for Auto-Increment ID, T stands for Project Type, and R stands for Project ID.
4. Following this system, an invoice auto-numbering format set as YYMMRRRRRR would create a number that includes the year and month of the invoice and the six project digit ID of its associated project, in that order.
5. The value you add to the NEXT ID field will determine the number your auto-numbering invoicing system will start from. For instance, if you set your auto-numbering format as MMPPP, and you create an invoice in April, and you set the value in the NEXT ID field as 1, then the number on your invoice would be 04001.
6. Below the FORMAT and NEXT ID fields, you'll see a box labeled ENFORCE UNIQUE INVOICE NUMBER. Checking this box will ensure that none of your invoices share the same number.
7. Once you've configured your auto-numbering settings the way you'd like, you can click the blue SAVE button at the bottom of your window. If you still have questions about auto-numbering, take a look at the FAQ article to learn more.",392

Solution: Consolidated invoices can help you stay organized and make it easier on your client. They'll get one invoice instead of many. This article will answer some of your most commonly asked questions.

1328,Invoicing,Showing Subtotals on Your Invoice,"Topic: Showing Subtotals on Your Invoice
Solution: BigTime added support for 11 different subtotal types to help firms create more detailed and helpful invoices. Subtotaling by Labor Code/Rate or Task allows for more accurate reporting and invoicing. 

When creating a simple T&M invoice with no subtotals, the system will only create a single line item for time and one for expenses. However, for many firms, this level of detail is not helpful. To address this issue, BigTime added support for 11 different subtotal types. 

By subtotaling by Labor Code/Rate, for example, the resulting invoice line items will show the total hours logged against the project by labor code, as well as the actual billing rate at which those hours are being billed. This level of detail can be useful for reporting purposes as well. Subtotaling by Task allows for more accurate reporting on exact invoiced amounts by task. 

Overall, by utilizing the various subtotal types available in BigTime, firms can create more detailed and helpful invoices that provide a clearer picture of the work being done and the associated costs.",223

1338,Invoicing,Custom Invoicing Examples,"Topic: Benefits of using custom invoices for specific billing scenarios
Solution: Custom invoices can be used for retainer-based billing, deposits and credits, discounted rates, and administrative markups to present detailed information and provide creative solutions.

Custom invoices can be a useful tool for presenting detailed information and providing creative solutions in specific billing scenarios. By using custom invoices, businesses can tailor their billing process to fit their unique needs. Here are some examples of when it makes sense to use custom invoicing:

1. Retainer-based billing: If a business charges clients a retainer fee for ongoing services, a custom invoice can be used to clearly outline the services provided and the amount of the retainer fee.

2. Deposits and credits: Custom invoices can be used to track deposits and credits for services or products that are not yet fully paid for. This can help businesses keep track of outstanding balances and ensure that payments are received in a timely manner.

3. Discounted rates: If a business offers discounted rates for certain products or services, a custom invoice can be used to clearly show the original price, the discounted price, and the amount saved.

4. Administrative markups: Custom invoices can be used to add administrative markups to the cost of products or services. This can help businesses cover the cost of administrative tasks such as processing orders or managing inventory.

In conclusion, custom invoices can be a valuable tool for businesses looking to present detailed information and provide creative solutions in specific billing scenarios. By tailoring their invoicing process to fit their unique needs, businesses can improve their billing efficiency and better serve their clients.",320
1339,Invoicing,Deposit Invoice – Parameters,"Topic: Deposit Invoice Parameters

Solution: The article discusses the parameters of a deposit invoice, which include a minimum deposit balance of $5,000 and a deposit payment of $10,000. The customer gives a down payment of $10,000 when the contract is signed, and each time an invoice is created, a credit for 10% of the fees is given. The deposit is worked down as the customer pre-pays. The author also mentions wanting a perpetual deposit, where if the balance falls below $5,000, another $10,000 will be charged. The article concludes by suggesting several scenarios to consider with these parameters in mind.",132
1340,Invoicing,Multiple Scenarios,"Topic: Understanding Deposit Balance Changes in T&M Invoices
Solution: T&M invoices are generated monthly with varying amounts of fees and expenses. As a result, the deposit balance will change each month. It is important to keep track of these changes to ensure accurate accounting and budgeting.

By monitoring these scenarios and keeping accurate records, businesses can effectively manage their T&M invoices and maintain financial stability.",107
1341,Invoicing,Scenario 1 – Deposit Balance Is $0,"Topic: How to handle a $0 deposit balance in the first month of invoicing.

Solution: In the first month of invoicing, it is common to have a $0 deposit balance since there has been no deposit made yet. To handle this scenario, create an invoice with a deposit amount using a single line item that says ""deposit"" for the desired amount, such as $10,000. This will ensure that the invoice reflects the deposit balance accurately and helps to avoid confusion for both the invoicer and the recipient.",106
1342,Invoicing,"""Scenario 2 – Deposit Balance Is $10,000""","Topic: Deposit Balance Management
Solution: In order to manage deposit balances effectively, it is important to keep track of the balance and understand the fees and credits associated with it. In this scenario, the deposit balance starts at $10,000 and 10% of the fees are credited back against the deposit, resulting in a deposit credit of $1,000. This pattern continues until the balance falls below $5,000, at which point an additional $10,000 must be added to the deposit. By monitoring the balance and understanding the associated fees and credits, deposit balances can be effectively managed to ensure financial stability.",125
1343,Invoicing,"""Scenario 3 – Deposit Balance Is $3,000""","Topic: Deposit Balance Falling Below $5,000
Solution: The article suggests two solutions for when the deposit balance falls below $5,000. 

When the deposit balance falls below $5,000, there are two additional line items that need to be added to the invoice. The first solution is to add a deposit credit for $1,000, which is based on the $10,000 in fees. The second solution is to add a deposit for $10,000, which is a replenishment amount to bring the deposit balance back up to $5,000. By implementing these solutions, the deposit balance can be maintained at or above $5,000.",136
1344,Invoicing,Scenario 4 – Deposit Balance Is $500,"Topic: Customized Line Items for Invoicing Scenarios
Solution: The article suggests that a standard invoice template may not be sufficient for certain scenarios, such as when a deposit balance is low but there are still outstanding fees.

1363,Invoicing,Leapfrog Invoice Approvals,"Topic: Leapfrog Invoice Approvals
Solution: Leapfrog approvals is an optional invoice review and approval feature that expedites the invoice approval process by skipping reviewers. This means that if you have multiple reviewers for an invoice, and one of them approves it before the others, the skipped reviewers will no longer be able to review the invoice. However, the remaining reviewers can still review and approve it. To use this feature, you need to indicate that you want to use leapfrog approvals when setting up your invoice approval process.",105
1364,Invoicing,What Is Leapfrog?,"Topic: Leapfrog Explanation for Invoice Review Process
Solution: Leapfrog is a feature that allows the invoice review process to skip the primary reviewer and continue to the remaining reviewer if the primary reviewer is skipped. This means that the primary reviewer cannot accept or reject the invoice. However, if leapfrog is not activated, then all reviewers need to review and approve the invoice. It is important to keep in mind that invoice reviewers can review an invoice at any time and the review process does not flow sequentially from the first reviewer to the fourth. Once the invoice review process is kicked off, all of the reviewers are notified and any reviewer can take action in any order. An example is given where three reviewers are involved, and the secondary reviewer approves an invoice before the primary one. If leapfrog is activated, then the primary reviewer is skipped and the invoice review process continues to the remaining reviewer.",177
1365,Invoicing,Leapfrog Scenarios,"Topic: Leapfrog Scenarios in Invoice Approval Process
Solution: Leapfrog scenarios can be used in the invoice approval process to skip reviewers and streamline the process. However, if an invoice is rejected, it needs to be resubmitted and reviewed by the primary reviewer.

When using leapfrog scenarios in the invoice approval process, it is possible to skip reviewers and expedite the process. For example, if there are four reviewers and the final approver approves the invoice, the three people ahead of them are skipped and the invoice is approved.

However, if an invoice is rejected by a secondary reviewer, the primary reviewer is skipped and the invoice needs to be resubmitted. In this case, the primary reviewer can review the invoice once it has been resubmitted.

It is important to note that while leapfrog scenarios can be useful in streamlining the invoice approval process, they should be used with caution. Skipping reviewers can lead to errors and oversights, so it is important to ensure that all necessary parties have reviewed and approved the invoice before it is finalized.",213

1. Click on ""MY COMPANY...PENDING APPROVALS"" from your navigation bar.
2. Click on ""EDIT SETTINGS"" on the ""INVOICES"" tile.

The invoice review and approval workflow feature in BigTime is a simple but effective way to ensure that drafted invoices are complete and accurate before they are sent out. To activate this feature, simply draft an invoice and start the invoice review process from the drafted invoice. You can choose multiple reviewers to review and approve the invoice.

Once the invoice review process is started, the chosen reviewers will receive a notice in their BigTime inbox that alerts them of the invoice to review and directs them to it. They can then accept or reject the invoice on their ""REVIEW/APPROVE INVOICES"" window.

This feature provides many options for the invoice review and approval workflow, including who can review and approve invoices. By using this feature, you can ensure that your invoices are accurate and complete before they are sent out, which can save time and prevent errors.",217

Solution: The review and approval process for invoices in BigTime follows a specific path. To start the review process, click the ""FORWARD TO REVIEW"" hyperlink in the drafted invoice. Reviewers will receive a notice in their BigTime inbox, which directs them to the invoice that needs to be reviewed. Any invoice reviewer can review an invoice at any time.

Reviewers can either approve or reject an invoice and add notes to explain their decision. If a reviewer has the user right ""Create New Invoices,"" they can also edit an invoice by accessing the Invoice Detail, Time, and Expenses tabs on the drafted invoice.

If an invoice is rejected, any staffer with rights to create invoices can re-submit it. This means any system administrator or staffer with the user right ""Create New Invoices"" and is either on the team for that project or has the user right ""View/Manage Any Project.""

Approval is the final step in the workflow, certifying that the invoice is accurate and ready to be sent to the client. To stay on top of the invoice reviewal process, use BigTime's notification system (""MY COMPANY...NOTIFICATIONS""). Notices are turned on by default and will keep reviewers informed when invoices are ready for review.",263

1393,Invoicing,Why Custom Invoicing?,"Topic: Custom Invoicing in BigTime

Solution: Custom invoicing in BigTime allows users to create invoice templates that can perform tasks that basic BigTime templates cannot. With custom invoicing, users have control over the information contained in line items, which are the core components of invoices. Users can add detailed descriptions and formulas that auto-calculate, as well as include conditions so that the line item executes only if the condition is met. 

Custom invoicing is a Premier-level feature in BigTime, but Pro-level users can import specific, pre-made custom calculators. An example of how custom invoicing can be used is when a customer gives a down payment of $10,000 per the contract. Each time an invoice is created against the project, a credit for 10% of the fees is created. However, if the balance falls below $5,000, another $10,000 will be charged. All of these details can be captured with custom invoicing. 

This article provides a summary of the key aspects of custom invoicing in BigTime and directs users to specific articles about each feature.",225

To create custom invoices, several scenarios can be set up. These scenarios can be used to create custom line items that are specific to the needs of the business. By using custom invoices, businesses can streamline their billing processes and ensure that they are accurately charging their clients.

Retainer-based billing is a common scenario that can be easily managed with custom invoices. By setting up a retainer-based billing scenario, businesses can ensure that they are receiving payment for their services on a regular basis. Deposits and credits can also be managed through custom invoicing scenarios, allowing businesses to easily track payments and credits.

Discounted rates can be applied to custom invoices, allowing businesses to offer special pricing to their clients. Administrative markups can also be added to custom invoices, allowing businesses to charge for additional services or expenses.

In conclusion, custom invoicing scenarios are a valuable tool for businesses that require flexibility in their billing processes. By using custom invoices for retainer-based billing, deposits and credits, discounted rates, and administrative markups, businesses can streamline their billing processes and ensure that they are accurately charging their clients.",298

Solution: When adding a new currency to your currency list in BigTime, the system will automatically pull the exchange rate between that currency and your base currency for the current date as a baseline. However, you can add a start date and an end date for your exchange rates in your Edit Currency window. This feature allows you to add multiple exchange rates for different time periods to your system. To do this, click the calendar icon below the end date field and select the date after which your exchange rate will no longer apply. BigTime will generate a new row for you to add a second exchange rate when you click on that date. The start date for the second exchange rate will automatically fill in as the day following the last exchange rate's end date to ensure there is no time gap or overlap between the two exchange rates. Once you have updated your exchange rate dates, click the blue Save button to save your changes. Now, whenever you create a multi-currency invoice or bill before the end date of the first exchange rate, BigTime will use that exchange rate. After the end date, BigTime will use the second exchange rate. You can continue to add as many exchange rate rows as your firm needs.",258

Topic: Multi-Currency Invoicing in BigTime

Solution: BigTime allows for multi-currency invoicing and billing. When creating a multi-currency invoice or bill before March 31st, the exchange rate used will be 0.7. After March 31st, the exchange rate used will be 0.9. Additional exchange rate rows can be added as needed.",81
1410,Invoicing,How To Update Foreign Exchange Rates for Billing and Invoicing,"Topic: BigTimes Multi-Currency Feature for Invoicing and Billing
Solution: How to Edit Exchange Rates for Currencies

BigTimes multi-currency feature for invoicing and billing allows for automatic conversion of your firm's home currency into any foreign currency of your choice. This is done by pulling exchange rates for each currency on a daily basis from xe.com, ensuring the most accurate conversion between your currencies. However, there may be instances where you need to edit the exchange rate for a specific currency. 

To edit the exchange rate for just one currency, open the ""EDIT CURRENCY"" window for that currency by clicking the hyperlinked name of the currency from your currency list. You will see two fields where you can edit the exchange rate between your base currency and the foreign currency selected. Type your new values into their respective text boxes, and then click ""SAVE"" to save your changes. 

Another way to edit exchange rates is from your invoice creation window. This makes sense if you need to change the exchange rate for just one invoice. Follow the steps to create a draft invoice, and then look for the ""EXCHANGE RATE"" field at the bottom of your invoice finalization screen. Here, you can type the new exchange rate between your base currency and the home currency of the client you're invoicing for. You'll see the amount in your base currency ""SUBTOTAL"" field change to reflect your new exchange rate. Click ""SAVE CHANGES"" to save your updated invoice, and then follow the same steps you would to submit any other invoice. 

Finally, you can update the exchange rates for all your foreign currencies at once. This may be necessary if you want all your currencies to reflect exchange rates for the same specific date. Go to your currency list and click the ""UPDATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES"" button located next to your ""ADD CURRENCY"" button. This will open a new window where you can bulk edit the exchange rates for all your currencies. 

To do this, add a new date to the ""EFFECTIVE DATE"" field by clicking the ""CALENDAR"" icon on the right side of the field and choosing a new date from the dropdown calendar that appears. Keep in mind that any date you choose has to be after the latest end date for any of your currencies. After selecting your new date, click the blue button labeled ""GET MARKET RATES"" to apply the new date to your currencies. You'll see the list in this window update to reflect the new exchange rates for that date. Click the ""SAVE"" button at the bottom of the ""UPDATE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES"" window to save your changes. 

In summary, BigTimes multi-currency feature for invoicing and billing is a powerful tool that can automatically convert your firm's home currency into any foreign currency of your choice. However, if you need to edit exchange rates for a specific currency or all your currencies, there are multiple ways to do so, including editing the currency window, invoice creation window, or updating exchange rates for all your foreign currencies at once.",620

Solution: With BigTime's multi-currency features, you can easily set up a currency for each international client in their settings. This ensures that any budgets, invoices, rates, or payments created for that client will be in their home currency, making it easier for them to pay you. Here are the steps you need to follow to set up multi-currency billing for your international clients:

1. Go to the client's settings in BigTime.
2. Under the ""Billing"" tab, select the currency that the client will be billed in.
3. Save the changes.

1414,Invoicing,Setting a Clients Currency,"Topic: Setting a Client's Currency
Solution: To set a currency for a specific client, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Project List and open the project associated with that client.
2. Navigate to the CLIENT tab to open the CLIENT INFO window.
3. Scroll down to find the CLIENT CURRENCY field and select the appropriate currency for your client from the picklist generated by clicking the GRAY ARROW next to the field box.
4. Click the blue SAVE button at the bottom of your screen to save your selection.

Note: The currencies in the picklist reflect the ones you have set up in your currency list. If the currency you want to set for this client doesn't appear in the picklist, you need to add the currency to your currency list first.

Once you set a currency for a client, any bill or invoice you create for them will be generated in that currency. Any time you create a project in BigTime for that client, the currency for that project will automatically match your client's home currency. You can see this reflected on your project's DETAILS tab.

Note: The PROJECT CURRENCY field on your project DETAILS window will be locked. If you want to edit that currency, you'll only be able to do so from your CLIENT tab only if you haven't yet logged any transactions for your client. Once you log invoices, bills, or payments under a certain currency for your client, you won't be able to change their home currency.",298
1415,Invoicing,Invoicing with Multi-Currency,"Topic: Multi-Currency Invoicing in BigTime
Solution: BigTime allows you to create multi-currency invoices without any special workflow. After activating the feature and setting currencies for your clients and projects, BigTime will automatically calculate each client's invoice in their default currency. You can follow the same steps to create a draft invoice in your base currency to create a multi-currency invoice. 

When you activate multi-currency for invoicing in BigTime, you will see changes to your Invoicing overview page. The DRAFTS/FINALS tile and A/R AGING tile will remain unchanged, but you will now see two ARROWS on either side of your WORK-IN-PROGRESS tile. These arrows will allow you to toggle between your aggregated WIP invoice amounts in each currency your firm uses. The other two tiles will continue to only show amounts in your base currency.

To see the WIP invoice amounts for clients in different currencies, click on the arrows on either side of the WORK-IN-PROGRESS tile. When you click on the WIP tile, you will be able to see details for all your invoices in all your currencies, regardless of the currency that was displayed on your WIP tile. Enabling the CURRENCY field in this view will show you which currency is linked to each invoice. 

When you create a multi-currency invoice, you will see a few new fields appear near the bottom of the window when you click the FINALIZE button. Instead of one SUBTOTAL field, there will now be two: one in your client's currency, and one for your base currency. There will also be an EXCHANGE RATE field, where you will see the exchange rate between the two currencies. The EXCHANGE RATE field is date-specific and is determined by the date of your invoice and the exchange rate you set in your currency list. You can set your own custom exchange rates and their applicable start and end dates in your EDIT CURRENCY window, and have BigTime pull those exchange rates for your invoices. 

The EXCHANGE RATE field is editable, and if you make a change to the value in the field, the base currency SUBTOTAL field will recalculate to reflect this change. You can send a multi-currency invoice to a client the same way you would send any other invoice. Make sure to double-check that your invoice reflects the correct currency in your invoice PREVIEW tab before sending it to your client. 

If you would like to post a multi-currency invoice to your accounting system, you can follow the same steps you would to post any other invoice. When you post an invoice in a foreign currency to your accounting system, it will only post the amount in your client's currency. It won't post the invoice amount converted into your base currency. If you have multi-currency for invoicing and billing activated in your accounting system, the exchange rate on that invoice will also carry over from BigTime.",592
1416,Invoicing,Invoicing with Multi-Currency,"Topic: Creating and Sending Multi-Currency Invoices

Solution: BigTime allows you to create and send multi-currency invoices to clients without any special workflow. After activating the feature and setting currencies for clients and projects, BigTime will automatically calculate each client's invoice in their default currency. To create a multi-currency invoice, follow the same steps as creating a draft invoice in your base currency. 

When finalizing a multi-currency invoice, you will see new fields for the client's currency subtotal and the base currency subtotal, as well as an exchange rate field. The exchange rate is date-specific and can be set in your currency list or customized in the edit currency window. If you make changes to the exchange rate field, the base currency subtotal will recalculate accordingly. 

To send a multi-currency invoice to a client, double-check that the invoice reflects the correct currency in the preview tab before sending. If you want to post a multi-currency invoice to your accounting system, follow the same steps as posting any other invoice. However, only the amount in the client's currency will be posted, and the exchange rate on the invoice will carry over if multi-currency for invoicing and billing is activated in your accounting system.",249

Please note that this article assumes you already know how to add filter columns to your invoice overview window.",111
1418,Invoicing,Invoice Exchange Rate,"Topic: Understanding the Invoice Exchange Rate filter
Solution: The Invoice Exchange Rate filter displays the exchange rate between your base currency and the currency the invoice was created in. If your firm's base currency is different from the currency of the invoice, then selecting this filter will show you the exchange rate between the two currencies. For example, if your base currency is USD and you created an invoice for a client in the UK, then selecting this filter will display the exchange rate between USD and GBP. However, if an invoice was created in your base currency, then this field will remain blank. Understanding this filter can help you keep track of exchange rates and ensure accurate invoicing for international clients.",137
1419,Invoicing,Total Amount ($),"Topic: Total Amount ($) filter columns on invoice list screen
Solution: The article explains that there can be two TOTAL AMOUNT filter columns on the invoice list screen. The first column displays the actual amount being billed to the client and cannot be removed. However, when multi-currency for invoicing is turned on, there will be an option to add a second TOTAL AMOUNT column. This second column will show the invoice amount converted into the base currency if the invoice was created in a foreign currency. The symbol displayed next to the filter name will match the chosen base currency.",115
1420,Invoicing,Currency,"Topic: The Importance of the CURRENCY Filter in Invoicing
Solution: The CURRENCY filter is a useful tool for differentiating between multiple currencies that share the same symbol. By displaying the abbreviated name of the currency your invoice was created for, this filter can help prevent confusion and errors in invoicing. For example, if your firm uses both USD and CAD, which both share the $ symbol, the CURRENCY filter can help you easily distinguish between the two currencies.",95
1421,Invoicing,Bill Rates with Multi-Currency For Invoicing,"Topic: Creating and using rate cards with multiple currencies in BigTime

Solution: If you want to avoid updating rates for each project individually, you can create rate cards with set rates for staffers and share them across multiple projects. When you activate multi-currency for billing and invoicing, you can add a currency to any rate card you create. You can also add multiple currencies to one rate card, eliminating the need to create a separate rate card for each currency.

1428,Invoicing,FAQ: Multi-Currency For Invoicing and Billing,"Topic: Multi-Currency Feature in BigTime

Solution: 

1) Can I change my base currency?
You can change your base currency before logging any expenses, bills, payments, or invoices while BigTime's multi-currency feature is enabled. Once you log your first multi-currency expense or invoice, your base currency will be locked, and you won't be able to change it to another currency. Therefore, it's crucial to ensure that you have set the correct base currency for your firm before using BigTime's multi-currency tools.

2) Who can access my firm's currency list?
Only system administrators can access and make changes to your firm's active currency list.

3) Can I just use multi-currency for invoicing and billing, or do I need to have multi-currency for expenses activated?
You don't need to have both activated. When you activate multi-currency for invoicing and billing, you'll be prompted to set a currency for each of your clients, which will determine the default currency for the projects linked to those clients. Any expense you log toward a project will be converted to the currency you set for that project's client.

4) What's the difference between exchange rates for expenses and exchange rates for billing/fees?
BigTime pulls exchange rates for expenses for the specific day of the expense record from xe.com. However, exchange rates for billing/fees are dependent on how system administrators have configured date ranges in their currency list since invoices record charges over a period of time.

5) Why can't I change my client's currency?
A client's currency field locks as soon as a firm starts recording multi-currency transactions or expenses for that client's project. If you're unable to change a client's currency, it's likely because you've already logged time, expenses, or invoices in the currency you initially set for that client. This is to preserve the historical data for each of your project's financials.

6) Can a project's currency be different from the currency I set for that project's client?
No, a project's currency will always automatically match the one you set for that project's client.

7) How are cost rates tracked when I turn on multi-currency features?
When you have multi-currency features activated, your cost rates will be tracked in your firm's base currency.

8) Why don't I see an exchange rate on every invoice I make?
The exchange rate field will only appear on invoices that are drafted in currencies other than your base currency. If you don't see an exchange rate on your invoice, it's because the invoice was recorded using your base currency.",533
1429,Invoicing,FAQ: Multi-Currency For Invoicing and Billing,"Topic: Multi-Currency Transactions in Project Management

Solution: When using multi-currency transactions in project management, there are certain limitations and rules that must be followed. Once a client's currency is set, it cannot be changed if time, expenses, or invoices have already been logged in that currency. The same currency will be automatically applied to the project associated with that client. Cost rates will be tracked in the firm's base currency when multi-currency features are activated. It is not possible to change the client associated with a project if multi-currency invoicing and billing are being used. The exchange rate field will only appear on invoices that are drafted in currencies other than the firm's base currency.",140

1435,Billing Rates,What Are Custom Billing Rates?,"Topic: Custom Billing Rates

Solution: Custom billing rates are exceptions to the base rate rule and can override any base rate for a specific project. For instance, if a staffer has a staff base rate of $100 but has a custom rate of $300 when logging time to ABC Studios, the custom rate will automatically override the base rate for this project. It is important to use custom billing rates when there are exceptions to the base rate rule.",89
1436,Billing Rates,Types of Custom Billing Rates,"Topic: Types of Custom Billing Rates
Solution: Custom billing rates can be created based on staff members, categories (also known as labor codes), or tasks. These categories can also be used together to create custom rates for specific staff members and tasks. It is important to note that a base rate contingent on a column, such as categories or tasks, must also be included in the timesheet for the rate to calculate properly. Additionally, companies can customize the lexicon settings in BigTime to use their own terminology for tasks and categories. Overall, custom billing rates provide flexibility and customization options for businesses to accurately bill for their services.",126
1437,Billing Rates,Custom Rates: Staffer,"Topic: Custom Billing Rates for Staffers
Solution: In cases where a staffer has a billing rate that differs from the base rate established for a project, a custom billing rate can be created for that specific staffer. This custom rate will override the project's base rate. For example, if Charlie has a billing rate of $300 while the project's base rate is $100, a custom billing rate can be created for Charlie at $300. This ensures that Charlie's billing rate is accurately reflected in the project's billing.",105
1438,Billing Rates,Custom Rates: Categories,"Topic: Custom Rates: Categories
Solution: You can create a custom billing rate based on the type of work being done for a project, such as consulting, editorial, or R&D. This is useful when a type of work has a different billing rate than the base rate established for the project. In the image provided, consulting has a higher billing rate than the base rate for the project, so a custom rate of $300 was created for it. This custom rate will be applied to any staffer who does consulting work for the ABC Studios project, regardless of who selects it.",116
1439,Billing Rates,Custom Rates: Tasks,"Topic: Custom Billing Rates Based on Tasks
Solution: Custom billing rates based on tasks is a way to break projects into different parts and charge specific rates for each part. For example, you can create custom billing rates based on tasks (units of work) you've created for a specific project. In the image below, ""Blog Post"" has a rate of $50.

1453,Billing Rates,Using Custom Rates As Your Default Rate,"Topic: Using Custom Rates As Your Default Rate

This method allows for easier rate management and eliminates the need to edit/maintain rates in every project unless there are exceptions.",85
1455,Billing Rates,Billing Rates: Basic FAQs,"Topic: Billing Rates: Basic FAQs

Solution: 

1) Can I set up all of my projects to use the same base rate?
There isn't a default base rate in BigTime, but the system is smart about selecting a base rate when you create a new project. It will use the base rate from other projects for the same client (or from the last project you entered) to set the base rate when a new project is created.

2) When are billing rates applied to time?
Typically, a billing rate is applied to each entry as it's entered, then that rate is updated when you submit your timesheet. BigTime ensures that billing rates are updated to the current rate before each invoice is created.

3) If I adjust a project's rates, will invoiced time be adjusted?
No, once time is linked to an invoice, the billing rate is frozen. You would need to click the ""update rates"" link on a specific invoice in order to update the billing rates on time attached to that invoice.

4) Can I update rates manually?
Yes. There is an update rates button on the ""INVOICING...OVERVIEW"" page which will update the billing rate on ALL unbilled time in the system.

5) Are billing rates required if we don't bill in BigTime?
No, billing rates aren't required, but they are extremely useful for reporting- even if all of your projects are fixed-fee or if you create invoices in your accounting system.",302

1512,Zapier,Integrate Bigtime With Zapier,"Topic: Integrating BigTime with Zapier
Solution: This article provides step-by-step instructions on how to integrate BigTime with Zapier, allowing you to connect your favorite BigTime feature with an endless list of other apps. 

To get started, make sure you have a Zapier account. If you don't, check out this article to learn how to create one. Once you have a Zapier account, follow these steps:

1. Click ""MY COMPANY...INTEGRATIONS"" on your navigation bar.
2. Scroll through the available integrations and click the tile labeled ""ZAPIER"". This will open a new window with your Zapier integration settings.
3. Click ""ENABLE"".
4. Click the hyperlink, ""CLICK HERE TO ACTIVATE BIGTIME"". This will cause a new tab to open.
5. Click the orange button to accept the invite and build a Zap (i.e., a notification).

Zapier works by setting triggers and actions. For example, you can send a Zap notification when an invoice is sent in BigTime. To set up these triggers and actions, you need to decide which status codes in BigTime will trigger Zaps. If you're only using Zapier to push data into BigTime, you can disregard this step. However, if you want to push data from BigTime into other applications, you'll need to make your status code selections. You can create Zaps for invoices, tasks, projects, and time and expense entries.

Let's take a look at this integration in action. You can have BigTime send Zap notifications based on the current status of a project, task, or invoice. For example, you can send a ""create task"" Zap when invoices are marked as sent. You choose the status code that triggers each Zap.

The first Zap you create in Zapier that uses BigTime will ask you to create a BigTime account. This is where you enter your credentials that will log into your BigTime account. With these steps, you can easily integrate BigTime with Zapier and streamline your workflow.",418

1515,Zapier,"""Triggers, Actions, and Zaps""","Topic: How Zapier works with triggers and actions.

For instance, you can make BigTime a trigger app, where the creation of a Project, Task, or Invoice can send an email or create a contact into your Google Account. Alternatively, you can select another application to act as the trigger app, automatically creating Tasks or Projects within BigTime. To set up a trigger and an action on Zapier's website, you need to select the trigger app and the action app, and then fill out the form.",135
1516,Zapier,Deciding Which Bigtime Status Codes Are Triggers,"Topic: Deciding Which Bigtime Status Codes Are Triggers
Solution: To use Zapier to push data from BigTime into other applications, ensure that the objects match up before going live. Choose the status code that triggers each of the Zaps based on the object's current status.

When using Zapier to get data into BigTime, the status code settings won't be used. However, if you want to use Zapier to push data from BigTime into other applications, it's important to make sure that the objects match up before going live. An object refers to the label or name of a particular field.

When creating a Project, Task, Invoice, or any other object in BigTime for the first time, there may not be enough information to warrant a Zap. BigTime will fire Zap notifications based on the object's current status. For example, you can send the ""Create Invoice"" Zap when your invoices are marked ""Sent"" instead of when they are in Draft mode. You will need to choose the status code that triggers each of the Zaps based on the object's current status.",223
1517,Zapier,Smart Match Enhances Zapier Integration,"Topic: Smart Match Enhances Zapier Integration
Solution: Smart Match allows BigTime IQ PRO to search for a match on values that exist in BigTime IQ, making it more convenient for users to send a Zap without specifying the exact type of data being passed into BigTime. Smart Match will try to match the existing BigTime values for Create Project and Create Timesheet, simplifying the process even further.",82
1518,Zapier,Heres How It Works,"Topic: How to use Smart Search in BigTime to link new Projects and Timesheets with existing data from other applications.

Solution: If you have used another application and want to create a new Project or Timesheet in BigTime using the Zapped information, BigTime's Smart Search will search for the value you are passing over and narrow down the possibilities. This will help you link your new Project with the correct existing Customer and your new Timesheet with the right staffer. Smart Search uses fields such as Staffer Email, Staffer Full Name, Staffer Last Name Only, Category/Labor Code, Task, No Charge, and Name (Either Yes or No) to match up Projects or Timesheets created in another program with your BigTime data. By using Zapier to move information from one app to another, you can work smarter and save time. Stick with the tools that work for you, and take advantage of the fact that Zapier connects more web apps than anyone, while BigTime adds new options every week.",205

1561,Sage Intacct,FAQ: Sage Intacct,"Topic: Integrating BigTime and Sage Intacct for Project and Customer Management
Solution: 

1) If both your project and customer are connected at the master level, both can be imported. The same is true if both your customers and projects are connected at an entity level. However, if your project is connected at an entity level, but your customer is connected at the master level, only the project will import.

2) Yes, you can import customers and projects from individual entities if your firm is set up at the Master level. However, because they're set up at a different level than your firm, you won't be able to sync transactions for those projects between BigTime and Sage Intacct.

3) Any time you create projects and customers in Sage Intacct, they will be created at the Master level. If you want to make your projects accessible at the entity level, you will need to edit the location of your project in BigTime first before exporting it to Sage Intacct. However, if you want to edit that project in Sage Intacct, you will only be able to do so at the Master level.

4) To avoid creating a duplicate client when creating a project in Sage Intacct, you'll need to make sure your client is added before you export a project from BigTime. Go to the Customer/Project screen in Sage Intacct, search for your client's name, and then click ""ADD+"" to add them. Now, when you add one of your projects to Sage Intacct, you'll see your client's name appear in the client dropdown menu.

5) If there are discrepancies between the info entered in BigTime and the info logged in Sage Intacct, this can prevent timesheets from posting between BigTime and Sage Intacct. Some fields need to match exactly on both platforms in order for timesheets to post. If your timesheets aren't exporting to Sage Intacct, first check whether the submission period on your BigTime timesheet matches the one in Sage Intacct. If the submission periods are the same, check whether the project and employee on your timesheet and in Sage Intacct were both created at the same level.

6) If the project associated with your invoice was linked to a specific entity in Sage Intacct, the invoice you post will appear in that entity's sales invoice location (""ORDER ENTRY...SALES INVOICE"").

7) If you are invoicing out of BigTime, then you will be able to post time as ""billed"" to Sage Intacct. Keep in mind that if you mark time as ""billed"" in Sage Intacct, you will not be able to delete that time from your account later on.

8) Whether you need the Time and Expense module depends on the kind of expenses you're posting. If you're posting them as expense journal entries or as accounts payable, you won't need to have the Time and Expense module. However, if you're posting employee expenses, you'll need to have the Time and Expense module to proceed.",642

1590,Salesforce,Salesforce Integration 101,"Topic: Benefits of Integrating BigTime and Salesforce Accounts
Solution: Integrating your BigTime and Salesforce accounts can provide several benefits, including preventing double-data entry, reducing mistakes, keeping your sales and project teams informed and connected, and staying organized.

Integrating your BigTime and Salesforce accounts can save you time by entering project information only once and seeing it in both platforms. When a Salesforce opportunity reaches a specified stage in your sales pipeline, it is automatically added in BigTime as a project. This allows you to add project details and sync BigTime information with Salesforce.

By reducing mistakes that inevitably occur when doing tasks like data entry repeatedly, you can ensure that all project details, like budgets and team members, are accurate and up-to-date in both platforms. This can also help keep your sales and project teams informed and connected, as project managers will have visibility into project statuses and can allocate resources and plan for future work. At the same time, sales teams can see how a project is tracking in Salesforce, which can impact when they follow up with clients.

Above all, integrating your BigTime and Salesforce accounts is an easy way to stay organized, since all project details, like budgets and due dates, are together in one place.

Click on the ""BANKING"" tab, and select ""MAKE DEPOSIT"" from the dropdown menu that appears to view this data. Once one of these pending payments is deposited, QuickBooks will automatically create two general journal entries associated with the payment – one for the deposit amount, and one for the payments transaction fees. The purpose of these journal entries is to provide extra context about each payment so you can have more accurate records of your firm's financial operations. However, sometimes errors occur while syncing payments to QuickBooks from BigTime. In such cases, these journal entries may not automatically appear when a pending payment has been deposited. If this is the case, or if you prefer to add them yourself, you can manually add journal entries for payments to QuickBooks by following the steps provided.",201
1612,QuickBooks,How To Manually Add QuickBooks Journal Entries,"Topic: How to manually add QuickBooks journal entries
Solution: To manually add QuickBooks journal entries, follow these steps:

1. Within QuickBooks, click on the ""Company"" tab in your navigation bar, and select ""Make General Journal Entries"" from the dropdown menu that appears. This will open a new window where you can manually add payment journal entries.

2. You'll see a spreadsheet with header tabs labeled ""Account,"" ""Debit,"" ""Credit,"" ""Memo,"" ""Name,"" ""Bill,"" and ""Class."" Since each payment needs to be pinned to two general journal entries with separate credit and debit amounts, you're going to create those entries in this spreadsheet line by line. You'll start by making an entry to record the deposited payment amount. The ""Account"" header will designate either the type of payment you're recording or where the deposit amount will go. In the first row under this header, click the gray arrow and select ""Undeposited Funds"" from the picklist that generates.

3. Now, you'll add the amount associated with the first journal entry. Your ""Undeposited Funds"" amount will need to list an amount in the ""Credit"" column, so add the amount that matches to the pending payment you're creating the journal entry for. The number you type in that column will automatically be added in the ""Deposit"" column for the second row. The ""Account"" column in the second row will determine where your deposit will be sent. Select the relevant option from the dropdown menu that generates from the picklist – in this example, we've chosen ""My Bank."" You can also add details about your deposit into the ""Memo"" column if you so choose. This will attach to your journal entry in case you need to reference it later.

4. Since you want to create two journal entries for one of your payments, you'll have to manually add the transaction fee journal entry as well. First, click the ""Save"" button in the top toolbar. This will save your first entry and clear the spreadsheet below. Now, click ""New"" and follow the same steps above to enter information for your second journal entry.

5. Once you're satisfied with the changes you've made, you can click the ""Save & Close"" button in the bottom right corner. Now, when you go to ""Company…Make Deposits,"" you'll see the journal entries you just created appear in your ""Payments to Deposit"" window. Check the boxes next to your payment and the two corresponding journal entries. Then, click the blue ""OK"" button at the bottom of your screen to create a record of the payment. If everything has been recorded correctly, the amount next to ""Deposit Subtotal"" at the bottom of your screen will be zero. Now you've successfully added a general journal entry and tagged it to a payment manually in QuickBooks.",582

Solution: QuickBooks and BigTime can be synced to share data such as company information, customers, jobs, employees, vendors, GL accounts, items, sales tax codes, classes, payroll items, terms, time activities, bills/checks, credit card entries, and invoices. Users with QuickBooks Desktop need to download the Sync Agent, while users with QuickBooks Online do not need to install software. The table below shows a list of all the data types that are shared between BigTime and QuickBooks, indicating whether the data is List or Transaction data. When syncing data, information that originates in QuickBooks is applied to BigTime, populating employees, vendors, and service items into their respective fields in BigTime.

The BigTime import engine is flexible, allowing users to delete or block jobs they do not want to see. In BigTime, customers are imported as client/projects, and jobs are imported as projects. QuickBooks supports 2-3 levels of jobs, so BigTime imports the lowest level in the QuickBooks hierarchy. Staff members can be invited to log in to BigTime, and time entries can be posted to QuickBooks from the ""QUICKBOOKS...POST TIMESHEETS"" page in the system.

Solution: The article provides instructions on how to sync BigTime data with QuickBooks and the various options available for syncing.

The article starts by discussing the options available under the General tab, which include using jobs in QuickBooks, enabling updates, and class integration. It explains that using jobs in QuickBooks is typically done for every BigTime project and provides instructions on how to check the box for this option. Enabling updates is an option to import QuickBooks data without automatically updating customers and jobs. Class integration allows setting a default class on a project, task, or staffer to prevent relying on staff to make the selection when entering time and expenses.

The article then moves on to discuss the options available under Field Mappings, located near the bottom of the General tab. The first option is Import/Export Customer/Job Data, which is where the user decides how to sync BigTime data with QuickBooks. The article explains the different options available, including not creating jobs automatically in BigTime, importing jobs (no updates), importing all QuickBooks updates (1-way), and syncing updates to QuickBooks (2-way). It provides examples of how each option works and how it affects syncing data between the two platforms.

The article also discusses the BigTime Project Name Source and Billing Address Sync Option, which are both important for syncing data between BigTime and QuickBooks. The former is the format for how project names export to QuickBooks, while the latter updates billing contact information and addresses.

1665,QuickBooks,Tab 1: General,"Topic: Project Name Source and Billing Address Sync Option

To format project names for export to QuickBooks, the article recommends using the format ""PrjNm = [Project Name]"" and ""PrjID = [Project ID]"". For example, if a project called ""Project ABC"" has a project ID of 0025, the format would be ""PrjNm = Project ABC"" and ""PrjID = 0025"". 

Regarding the billing address sync option, the article explains that only client addresses and information come over on the initial push and need to be updated in both locations after the initial sync. However, if the contact is seen as the billing contact in BigTime, then a change to the contact in QuickBooks will update the billing contact in BigTime. 

Finally, the article advises users to click ""SAVE"" once they have made their changes and updates.",213
